IN THE EYES OF HIS FATHER

Ken, at 18
 had been raised to understand his Father's attitude towards the need for discipline for boys and in particular his need for it.&nbsp; 

Sir Lawrence Hammond had always been strict, but his stern attitude increased with Ken's age and he knew it would just continue that way.&nbsp; Mr. Hammond had no intention of letting up on his son and was always finding ways to increase the young boy&#8217;s shame and humiliation&nbsp; along with the regularity of his now routine spankings.&nbsp; 

Ken&#8217;s Father simply believed it was the young boy&#8217;s bottom that needed the attention and his bare bottom at that.&nbsp; He saw it as a separate entity to his son and when the boy misbehaved, it was his cheeky bottom that had misbehaved and needed to be dealt with in the most severe manner. 

The fact that Ken possessed an extremely plump rounded bottom for a boy was a constant irritation to him and more so as his Father constantly reminded him of the fact the lad had the highly sensitive and vulnerable behind of a girl. 

Ken often studied his long smooth bare legs in the mirror and could not help but notice the way his buttocks stuck out so much from a side profile.&nbsp; His Father insisted on the boy keeping his legs shaved because he insisted they were pretty as a girl&#8217;s so Ken would have to treat them as if belonged to a girl instead of a &#8216;sissy boy&#8217;.

Would this change as the shy young lad got older?&nbsp; Ken didn't know but certainly hoped so. 

His Father often commented that most girls would die for such a high cheeked well rounded bottom. Embarassing as it was to the school child, Mr. Hammond often described to the blushing youngster the manner in which his derriere had a natural wiggle to it as he walked and that such a girlish rear end should wear panties and not jockey shorts. 

This made the youngster very conscious of its fullness but not as much as when his ripe tender behind was bared and stuck high in the air for a lengthy leathering from one of his Father's many straps making Ken&#8217;s southern exposure experience a very unpleasant heat wave. 

The fact that Ken was still kept in extremely short pants did not help his predicament, of course, and especially as some of the legs exposed a large portion of his generous bottom cheeks. Some of the very short shorts buttoned down the back and one pair had 22 small buttons making the boy unable to do them up or down himself. 

Having his Father undo these shorts some afternoons before a spanking was a slow process but it allowed for Mr. Hammond&#8217;s long scolding and prep talk for what was about to happen to his soon to be very bare round bottom had Ken in tears even before the very painful chastisement.&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;m going to see to it &#8216;little pansey&#8217; that this hurts you a lot. Then I&#8217;ll sit you on your punishment stool in your meditation corner for quite a while giving you a lot of time to think about whether or not this spanking is finished for the night. Maybe, maybe not.�

His Father would sometimes teased Ken by asking him what implement should be used with that particular punishment making the lad choose his own instrument of pain and then surprising him with a change at the last minute.&nbsp; 

Sometimes when the older man got the boy&#8217;s shorts and panties off instead of proceeding with the spanking Mr. Hammond would make Ken stand in the corner with his nose pressed to the wall bare-bottomed and front saying, �Your spanking can wait.&nbsp; I have a few things to do.� Then leave the poor humiliated lad to be seen by anyone coming into the living room for how long the chagrined miscreant would not know.&nbsp; He just knew that his nose should not leave that wall or his Father would make him regret it.&nbsp; 

Voices he recognized, many of them female, often passed through the room reddening his facial cheeks but the worse was thinking about the forthcoming reddening and pain the bare-bottomed lad would receive from his Father&#8217;s strap.

Being a good looking boy also motivated his Father to reduce him to a lip pouting blubbering frightened &#8216;wimpy faggot&#8217; removing most of the masculine aggression in his personality keeping him fully under his stern control. 

Ken had his hair long and dyed blonde with streaks.&nbsp; It hung down to his shoulders unless he had it in a pony tail.&nbsp; The kids in his school would make his life miserable &#8211; especially if they caught him with panties on when changing for gym.

Discipline was always separate from punishment in the Hammond household. Punishment was when he seemed to break one of his Father&#8217;s many, many rules or seemed to disobey him in some tiny way. It could be a crooked stocking, a lock of untidy hair, or a lipstick left open. The worst was a stain in his panties because he was not allowed to masturbate without his Father&#8217;s permission.

Discipline however, was an entirely different matter.&nbsp; Discipline involved very regular spanking of Ken&#8217;s bare bottom and thighs, front and back. It was designed to keep Ken behaving at his best, to remind him he was under his Father's rules and control, to make him continually try harder to be pleasing, mannerly and at his most obedient. Ken even had what his Father described as 'good boy spankings' and these were usually lengthy affairs. 

Mr. Hammond's theory was that if Ken had been a good &#8216;sissy miss&#8217;, it was because of the hard spankings he was receiving and therefore needed more to help him continue in that manner. 

Any exhibition of masculine aggression, even raising his voice was punished and after school instead of playing baseball or football Ken would have to come home and do the housework in just his panties so as not to get his other clothes dirty.

Some of Ken's friends were spanked, some more than others 
and some on their bare bottoms, but mainly when they had 
misbehaved and had done some misdeed. 

Ken, however, was spanked on his bare bottom on a very 
regular basis with a variety of implements. Some of these 
"discipline" spankings were actually worse than his punishment spankings and could involve up to 4 or 5 implements, all chosen by his Father for his particularly rotund buttocks. 

These implements included eight leather straps, 4 whippy canes, 2 very firm paddles, a riding crop, 2 large rulers and an array of&nbsp; brushes, belts, wooden spoons, spatulas and slippers (and a partridge in a pear tree).&nbsp; Mr. Hammond did not believe that a Father could have too many implements available for a plump bottomed &#8216;sissy boy&#8217; and he was always looking to add to his bed box which contained them.
 
A steel spatula in his local market may be viewed by most as to its use in the kitchen, but Mr. Hammond&#8217;s first thought and image was that of Ken and his bare bottom or plump thighs as he discreetly slapped it into his open palm. 

Checking a hairbrush and bath brush section of a store was second nature to him now and the hardware store also offered many useful tools to help teach his son the manners and lessons he needed to learn. 

Occasionally he visited the local horse riding store to examine some lengths of leather or some pieces that could be used to secure Ken's wrists or ankles for a judicial caning he occasionally received. 

Sir Lawrence often mused on the tales of his Father where a leather harness maker could be visited and a choice piece of leather ordered to be made for a recalcitrant son or daughter. Some were even said to have a bench at the back of the store where a youth could be positioned and left there as his Father or Uncle went shopping. 

The harness maker could then study the bared backside of the miscreant to help choose the finest piece of thick leather to assist its guardian in chastising it thoroughly.
 
On his return, a few choice pieces would be ready and could be tried out with 'the impudent one' secured across the bench. 

Some Fathers took the opportunity to deliver an overdue lengthy strapping while choosing the best piece. This was then left to be oiled and polished and narrowed at the handle, before being collected some days later. 

Aside from this, his Father had a strap and cane hung on Ken's bedroom wall close to his bed and a paddle on his bedside dresser. 

The main reason for this was his quite regular routine of a hard spanking at his bedtime, a routine copied from his own Father as he dealt with him or his brother for all those years. 

A bedtime spanking was mainly to focus Ken on the next day and he was encouraged to continue his good behaviour, if he had behaved well that day. 
 
These sessions were also used to help train Ken to "present" his bottom to the strap, a lesson that needed continual training for a boy. 

His Father was never happy with Ken's efforts at pushing his bare bottom up high for the relentless strap; at least he never let Ken feel he was happy.
 
He did note however his nice attempts to "help" his Daddy strap his bottom exceptionally hard, by pushing it up for him as high as he could, even though he was in some distress at his full force wallopings. 

He also knew that despite his best efforts to avoid his discipline, his bottom would in time naturally start to rise up to the strap involuntarily, a secret he learned from his Father.&nbsp; The reason for the phenomenon was not explained to Sir Lawrence, but he revelled in the fact that he had started to see traits of it with Ken, even though the &#8216;sissy boy&#8217; didn't realise he was doing it. 

He knew deep down that in time to come he would be pushing it off the bed as high as he possibly could the instant he heard his Father say 'Up'. 

This is also the reason he used the word continuously during a 'training strapping' as a type of hypnosis for the &#8216;little fag&#8217;. During a strapping, a stranger outside the door would hear the word mixed in with the continual instructions to "Give me your bottom Karen, up. That's it good &#8216;sissy girl, up higher now. Up for Daddy, up &#8216;sissy boy&#8217;, up higher, that's it hold it there. Push it up now. That's it. Stick it out for me; all directed at his very round and very bare bottom cheeks usually over two pillows, and on and on he would instruct during one of his many lengthy strappings. 

Ken would beg his Father to at least keep his panties on but Mr. Hammond was relentless. �Why don&#8217;t you take it like a man instead of the &#8216;sissy boy&#8217; you are?� Karen will be your name from now on. You don&#8217;t deserve a male name.

He also knew of course that if Daddy was displeased, the strapping could continue for some time until he was pleased enough to start to deliver the strapping he was due. This could take up to 20 minutes on some occasions along with his continual scoldings.
 
Sir Lawrence believed strict scolding was part of raising a &#8216;sissy boy&#8217; and keeping him under control. As his Father used to advise him, spank Ken hard and often, scold him harshly and continually, and control his bare bottom and his naughty penis, and he would have a very well behaved &#8216;sissy boy&#8217; regardless of his age. 

Of course he had seen this with his brother, even into his 20s. 

Ken's penis control was a totally separate matter but he knew it went hand in hand with his regular bare bottom discipline. 

Basically it was not to be touched, felt up, played with, stroked, rubbed on items or used in any such manner other than when urinating and even then he was to be careful. 

When he was being undressed for his preliminary scolding however, it could be used as part of his humiliation and could of course be examined, stroked and even smacked by his Father with the penis strap, if he felt the need.&nbsp; 

To this end Sir Lawrence often took the boy along or astride his bare thigh in preparation for a spanking.&nbsp; Lawrence understood how most Fathers used an over the knee position and stuck to it for the odd time they took their teen sons across the knee. Mr. Hammond, however, came to learn that many variations of over, along, astride, up on, back on, pinned in, even kneeling up on his knees, could be used in the chastisement of his boy. 

He continually tried out new positions on or about his knee and 
could often be found in his bedroom practising a new position 
with a thick pillow.
 
One he was very happy with, started with the boy standing at 
his closed together knees and leaning over his shoulder and he 
would reach around him and smack at his bottom and flanks. 
He would gradually slide both of his knees between his thighs 
and start to force Ken&#8217;s apart. This caused him to slide down his 
shoulder and his Father would scold for that, telling him to 'get 
back up over his shoulder for his well deserved spanking'. 

After a period of this Ken had to 'climb on' to astride his Father&#8217;s
knees and facing him and then lean his head over his Father&#8217;s 
shoulder or under his arm. 

In time with the slaps he would gradually be made to kneel 
up on his knees and the proximity of his privates to his 
Daddy's face made for a very discomforting discipline for 
the boy making him think of something he feared even more
than the spankings. 

His Father knew these did not allow for the very hard type of 
spankings he liked to administer, but the pushing, pulling, 
maneuvers, shame and scoldings it allowed for more than made 
up for this and gave Sir Lawrence pleasure in his swelling 
manhood. 

He also knew he could vary his scoldings, his boy's attire 
before and during a spanking, and indeed his own attire and 
demeanour in the course of administering the many, many 
spankings that went on in the young boy&#8217;s loving home.

Each piece of Ken's clothing was chosen with some care and 
designed to keep him as a well spanked boy should be kept. 

Lawrence's Father had taught him that there was nothing 
wrong with keeping a boy appearing in a manner that 
always invited a firm spanking, especially if he possessed a 
chubby round bottom like Ken did. 

Shirts, tops, blouses, halter suits, knee socks, ankle socks, 
ribbons, shoes all had a special place in Ken's wardrobe but 
most importantly in particular his underwear and pants. 

Sir Lawrence believed Ken's bottom was best suited squeezed 
into exceptionally short tight pants or on occasions bare under a short 
skirt. Ken liked to play tennis and his Father insisted his son wear pink
panties under a very short tennis skirt which billowed in the air 
embarassing the young boy with much.

He also used very short wide legged loose pants which fitted 
onto his upper bottom and when they went shopping, he paid 
close attention to how each pair looked, how it would shame 
him and how it might suit one of his many spanking sessions. 
He felt that Ken needed to be constantly aware of his well
rounded bottom and the need for clothing that helped show it 
off in its 'sticky out' fashion. 

Mr. Hammond knew he often had those fleeting thoughts about 
Ken&#8217;s bottom as he went about his daily work when he might pass him or be seen bending over for something or on hands and knees playing, and the thought was he needs a sound walloping with one of his thick leather straps ..... &#8216;I think I will spend some time this evening, helping him learn to push that bottom of his well up for the strap, hmm, yes, will do him no harm&#8217;

"Karen dear, I think a good strapping will do you good this evening dear, and we'll make it a very sound one, okay dear"?

A subdued reply of �.... Y ... yes Daddy" was quite usual as Ken let the new information sink in and his consciousness of his bottom in his very tight pants became all the more aware. 

"And perhaps a lengthy session with the bath brush on those 
fat bare cheeks of yours will help prepare you for the strap and 
get you crying properly.� 

The following "Y ... yes Daddy" was intoned with a little more 
alarm, as he knew his Father usually turned such a statement 
into a full shaming for him, but more importantly despite some of 
his leather straps being quite severe, he was really terrified of the
bath brush.&nbsp; It was long, hard and heavy and it impacted so "perfectly" 
with his bare bottom as his Father put it. But it also stung something terrible and his Father seemed to like using it with exceptional length.
So what may have been a straightforward bedtime strapping of a
dozen wallops could now turn into a full blown disciplinary session 
that terrified him. 

He hated the bath brush and more so as it always played a 
big part at his twice or thrice weekly bath times. It always made him think about how his handsome Father could be so stern and how methodically he went about gathering two fresh towels, one of his leather straps, a paddle and taking the bath brush down from its 
hook on bath nights.&nbsp; 

"We'll see if we can have you thrusting that big bare bottom of 
yours up a little higher tonight, for the proper, thorough strapping it deserves. If not we can fetch out the prison strap as we both know that always helps you concentrate on your bare behind when it is giving you its kisses, don't we, sweetheart"?

"Y.. y� yes Daddy, I will try my best, Daddy". 

"Oh you'll try your best alright, believe me honey, you will try 
exceptionally hard to please me and the thick strap I am 
going to use on you. It's all sissy girlie boys like you understand isn't dear?&nbsp; A thick leather strap across their bare backsides" 

Sir Lawrence was more directing this last comment to himself, but it is definitely a belief he truly held. As far as he was concerned, Ken thrived under firm discipline and he would continue to do so as long as he lived under his roof. 

Mr. Hammond also believed Ken thrived under the continual verbal 
reminding of his status with such humiliating treatment. He very much liked to be in the presence of a 'bare bottom scolding Father', and loved the ingenious way some used certain phrases for their sons, nephews, brothers or others in their care. 

While Sir Lawrence had many, many implements available to him for the raising of a well chastened son, there was more to it than varying the impact of his discipline. 

Certain items were used for different types of chastisement. 

For example, the oval polished clothes brush was used solely for 
a furiously fast walloping with Ken locked tightly between 
his thighs, with his son&#8217;s bottom being almost squeezed upwards 
for his Father&#8217;s attentions. 

The boy's wrists needed to be secured for these spankings. With the blistering pace of the hard spanking, Lawrence figured he applied between enough good firm smacks over a five minute period. 

Ken usually started bawling after about five kisses of the loving strap and Mr. Hammond liked the way Ken just settled into a nice helpless crying rhythm and heaving of buttocks during these furious discipline sessions. 

There was no scolding with these spankings and he did nothing 
but concentrate on delivering the spanks hard and fast to about 
two areas on his bottom cheeks. 

So, Ken knew what was to happen if he was sent for the oval 
clothes brush, as it sat in a drawer with a length of soft rope. 
No other type of spanking was administered with this brush. 

The riding crop was mainly for his thighs. He stood naked 
and raised a thigh for his Daddy to strike it 6 times on its 
top. Then he lowered it and raised the other for his Father. 

This went on and on as the thigh was usually not 'held up 
properly' for each of the 6 kisses, allowing for a prolonged 
treatment. 

This was also used for his 'prancing' training again designed to 
prolong. 

A switching was not liked by Ken one little hit.
 
Firstly, as it took a while to get the preparations right and 
second as they were usually quite intense for the boy. 

Out of the blue his Father would announce a switching. 
It involved him going to his room and stripping down and 
selecting a pair of panties that were to be 'shredded' during 
a switching. These were usually light see-through panties and 
it was all he would be wearing on his way to selecting 3 'nice 
whippy rods' for his Father. 

Ken did not like the way his Father described the types of 
switches he wished him to go and cut for him as the descriptions 
generally leaned towards one that will 'sink nicely into those 
fleshy buttocks of yours'. He also knew all three switches would
be used on him till they were almost useless. 

On occasions this chastisement would not involve just his 
bottom as Lawrence may decide she wanted to stripe 'every single 
inch of his plump thighs, front and back'. 

Ken knew to select three switches of varied thickness and he also 
knew each had better be to his Father&#8217;s satisfaction, unless he 
wanted to find himself in tears out fetching a further three. 

Mr. Hammond&#8217;s leather strap collection would be praised in the strictest of orphanages of old. He had eight straps in total and each one had its own particular flavour.

His Father still had his short over the knee strap for when he was much younger and he often mused on how after all the years it still had its uses when it came to Ken's discipline. He knew the sting of such straps and knew that when Ken howled at each stroke, it wasn't for show. 

His other three straps were plain double sided thick leather, 
the last being a Canadian prison strap. 

A few years back he had been chatting with a Canadian Father of 
two boys. This man had talked on and on at length about his boy's 
chastisement, but he noted keenly when he said something 
like, "of course if that happens, then it's out with the prison strap for them".&nbsp; 

After some close inquiry he researched it and found one and bought it. 
He was even more impressed with it when it arrived one afternoon. 
He opened the box which was about 20 inches long to find this curled piece of fine crafted leather and he knew at once that the comment from his chatting companion 'designed for the most recalcitrant boy&#8217;s bare bottom' was not an exaggeration. 

It was not easy to hold at first but he learned the uncurling of the 
leather was important when delivering a hard strapping with it. 
A beautiful tan colour at 30 inches long with a four inch handle 
and four inches wide with a solid �  inch thickness, it was a 
wonderful looking implement. 

Designed originally for grown men in Canadian prisons, he 
had found that some were sentenced to 30 strokes a day for the 
duration of their sentence. This was applied with the offending man strapped across a horse with a cushion placed beneath his hips for elevation of the buttocks, which were bared. 

30 strokes seemed a little lenient but he was happy to learn that 
often an offender was given many more for 'offensive behaviour' 
during his strapping.
 
Ken would certainly be getting many love taps with it.

Mr. Hammond held it in his hands and swung it about gently. He realised quickly that this strap was designed for over the head lashing 
and he knew immediately that due to its design, a 'lenient' strapping would be very difficult to administer with it. He placed it out flat 
on the table and called Ken to him and he arrived sharply and obediently. 

He told him to sit and he announced the arrival of a 'new 
disciplinary implement for his more and more deserving bare 
bottom cheeks&#8217;. 

Ken stared at the strap trying to take it in and only able to 
compare it to his other collection of punishment straps and he 
did not like what he saw. 

"It's designed for the bigger boy, Karen or perhaps they 
said the 'bigger bottomed girlie boy' I can't recall exactly, but it 
certainly looks ideal for you doesn't it, dear"? 

Ken was quiet, still trying to take in the picture of the 
strap on the table. This was surely going to hurt terribly, he 
thought. 

"There are even some notes with it, isn't that nice?"&nbsp; Sir Lawrence 
picked up and unfolded the little leaflet that accompanied the 
Beautiful gleaming instrument of chastisement. He ignored 
the details about the men's prison and went on, 

"Let's see, 'Designed to teach the most wilful miscreant the 
error of their ways, this strap will make a very sudden and 
lasting impression on the upturned bare buttocks of even the 
most disobedient subject. It can deliver a most severe 
punishment with a few dozen strokes and the user will find the 
only way to apply this strap is with great force. 

The miscreant should be placed along a bench if available and 
secured with its bottom elevated to help meet its very striking 
impact. Even the most well trained subject will find it difficult 
to present its own buttocks to this strap and its owner will find
training will almost need to be started over'. 

"Well Miss Chubby Bottom, isn't that interesting, we'll have to 
start to kiss your sweet bottom all over again for this strap. But 
that's not a problem; we can spend many evenings with it and see 
if we can teach you some new manners with this fine piece of 
chastising leather.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure that you will enjoy its making love to 
your girlie derriere." 

"What else is there, 'While the amount of strokes in the past 
with this strap was generally predetermined, in the hands of 
private disciplinary requirements, the user should find their own 
suitable measures and not limit themselves to the original 
stipulations '. 

�In other words Karen dear, you will need to be strapped at length, 
and that is what I intend to do with it. No sense in limiting ourselves
when it comes to the disciplinary requirements of your cheeky bottom, 
is there, dear"? 

Sir Lawrence liked the way he used his own words mingled with the 
ones in the leaflet as Ken sat almost motionless and very quiet knowing 
his Father's questions did not always require an answer or response but he suddenly started at "I said, is there sweetie pie?�

"No, no Daddy" was his instant response. 

"What else is there is there in this very informative leaflet?&nbsp; If the miscreant is used to other types of leather disciplinary implements, it may be of use to warm up the bottom cheeks beforehand with one or more of their regular straps for quite a while, before introducing their soon to be extremely sorry buttocks to this fine implement. This can be continued for the initial few weeks, but then it may 
be applied to a fresh pair of bottom cheeks.

Isn't that considerate Karen honey? 

"And what's left? This strap is ideally suited to the more 
plump bottomed miscreant, and while quite severe, it may be 
used on a frequent basis, if very instant obedience is a 
requirement'.
 
"If very instant obedience is a requirement! Well that is 
certainly a requirement when it comes to you isn't my little sissy?�
Lawrence asked as he crossed his legs and looked pointedly at the 
boy. 

"Yes Daddy, it is" 

"Yes it most certainly is and we've spent many hours teaching 
you and that bottom of yours that lesson, haven't we dear"? 

"Yes Daddy." 

Ken was still taking in the strap on the table when he noticed 
his Father's crotch and the large bulge under it.

This bulge was well known to Ken as he spent many hours 
across that lap and astride it, learning the many, many 
lessons his Father decided he needed to learn. 

Just the sight of it his lap and the bulging crotch reminded him of 
his bawling antics as a brush or paddle cracked repeatedly onto his upturned bottom. 

"Well then perhaps it will be required on a frequent basis 
then, what do you think dear, but then you think with that tiny
penis of yours, don&#8217;t you?&nbsp; That pathetic clitoris of yours could
never please a girl so we&#8217;ll have to make other arrangements.�

�Yes, Daddy.� The thought of&nbsp; �other arrangements� terrified Ken.
He could never get used to the way his Father incorporated 
his own agreement into his regular harsh discipline, but he 
knew better than to disagree. 

However he did not like the look of this particular addition to 
the disciplinary family of implements. 

"Well, I try my best, to be obedient Daddy". 

"Yes you do, dear but that is not always good enough now is 
it?" 

His Father's voice had now a sharper edge to it and he 
recognised it immediately. 

"Eh, no Daddy it isn't"
. 
"Of course it isn't sweet boy, and while you may think you are 
being instantly obedient when I tell you to do something, I may 
view it entirely differently. Isn't that correct, Ken"? 

"Em, yes Daddy, that is right" 

"Of course it is right dear girl. In fact it may be viewed as being 
disobedient, isn't that right"?
 
Ken did not like the way his Father had started to sound 
now. 

"Downright disobedient in fact".&nbsp; He was caught. 

"Em, well, I will try hard to be very obedient, Daddy, I 
promise I will". 

"Yes dear, you say that now when you see this strap on the 
table. You see, it's working already isn't it, you disobedient 
fruity pie?� 

"Yes Daddy .... it is". 

"An extremely disobedient little girl, that's what you are, 
aren't you?"

It was too late; his Father had walked him into the trap. 
To deny this would be seen as blatant cheek and he was too 
afraid of going there. He had no choice. 

"Yes ... yes Daddy". 

"And what happens to disobedient sissy boy girls?" 

"They get .... punished, Daddy"

"Yes dear sweetie pie they do. They get punished. Punished long, and 
punished hard on their very bare bottoms, with this long leather 
strap, which was specially designed for disobedient sissy boys and 
especially those with plump bottoms like yours. Isn't that right, Karen"?
 
"Yes, yes Daddy it is yes". 

"Well Karen honey let's not waste any more time on this. You heard 
what the leaflet said didn't you? So off you go and fetch two of 
your straps.

Get me the over knee one and the 16 inch tawse; they should be 
sufficient to warm you up properly for your first taste of this 
new big strap. But you can expect a good hand spanking too, boy, for your slow mumbling as you were questioned on the proficiency of 
this fine disciplinary strap I went to the trouble of acquiring for 
you. 

Sometimes I feel you are totally ungrateful for the efforts I 
put into your training and discipline and we will have to 
address that in the next few weeks.
 
Although this will be your first kiss of this fine strap, I intend 
using it in a full and proper manner across those full buttocks of 
yours and it will be an exceptionally lengthy strapping.&nbsp; I intend 
for this strap to make love to your bottom very thoroughly today, 
Karen, for the disobedient girlie boy that you are. I am sure you will 
be begging me to be allowed be an extremely obedient girl by 
the time I am finished with you and I am sure you will be 
repeating your feelings again tomorrow afternoon when we 
repeat these measures.

Of course at your bedtime tonight I will still expect full 
cooperation from your impudent bottom regardless of how well 
loved it may be.
 
Now over here and let me remove those little pants of yours. 
You may as well do your fetching bare bottomed today".
 
Sir Lawrence stood the boy just in the juncture of&nbsp; his slightly 
separated knees and pressing against his crotch exciting his
manhood. He eyed his son sternly as he slowly turned him awkwardly 
to get at his buttons that clasped tightly across those bottom cheeks. 

Slowly he unclipped each one with a little difficulty, as each 
one allowed a further piece of his plump bottom out. 

He always marvelled at the way his son&#8217;s bottom inched out of 
these pants and the way his generous fleshy cheeks assisted 
the undoing of each button, as his white silky panties came 
into view. 

Eventually the last button popped open and out fell the soon to 
be chastised naughty bottom. he slid the tight pants down his son&#8217;s
Legs and he knew to lift each foot to allow them to be removed and folded and placed on the table. 

They didn't take up much space and Mr. Hammond looked at them 
and wondered how on earth they contained such a bottom. 

The panties were not much better and he slowly slid them half way down his thighs.
 
"Leave those panties there as you pop off to get your straps.

Your panties won't be there for long of course as I'll be removing 
them completely when you return. I want that bottom completely 
bare today for its loving. 

Off you go and don't dawdle, sissy ". 

"Y yes Daddy", was the reply, as Ken took himself off to 
retrieve the straps he was told to. 

The reasoning behind this discipline session was long gone 
from his pretty head as he just knew his Father had to be 
right. 

How was he going to cope with that strap though? It looked 
terrifying, and the quivering of his bottom as he walked didn't 
help his plight in the eyes of his Father.
