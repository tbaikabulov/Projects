1. A
childhood lost

&nbsp;

�Rick. You have to
come with me. Your father has been taken to the hospital�

&nbsp;

I am Rick and I am 17
years old. I live in Filmore just north of L.A, where I have lived since I was
born. 2 year ago I lost my beloved mother. My father broke down and I very much
got to live my own life because he shut me off and concentrated on his job. I
was mourning also and my grade slipped because clothes, food etc. became a
struggle when my father did not have the strength to do
more than just calling for a pizza. In school I was isolated because I very
much arrived with dirty clothes the most of the time. I began to skip school
sometime 2 or 3 days per week.

&nbsp;

After 6 months the
school called my father because I became involved in a fight. They expelled me
and threatened my father with the social services. That was when Maria came
into our lives. My father enrolled me in a small Christian School
and it only took a week before I came into trouble when someone noticed that my
new school uniform had not been washed for a week. My father was called to the
office where the principal � Mr. Skinner - was told of our story. He had a
solution. His mom had just moved into a nursing home and her housemaid � Maria
� was out of a job.

&nbsp;

Maria became housemaid
by us. When I saw her the first time, both my fathers and my jaws dropped. She
was hot! Dark hair � almost 6
 foot high � 25 years � and what a body. Only her odd
black maid uniform with a white apron with bib front and cross-over straps
completed with a mob seemed out of time and place.

&nbsp;

Maria noticed our look
and explained that her former employer preferred her to be dressed like that
and that she wanted to continue to wear uniform unless we had something against
it. We didn�t. Maria got the house straightened out. Unfortunately I had been
on my own, so I had difficulties to do the same. Four weeks later I skipped
school and spent the entire day in the mall. The next day I was told to report
to the office of the Mr. Skinner.

&nbsp;

When I arrived at the
office the Mr. Skinner and Maria waited for me. The Mr. Skinner informed me
that I had broken the rules and according to the student handbook I had to be
punished by a parent, who should administer 5 strokes with the board (We pupils
called it the big educational board) while he was watching. Because my father
was working, he had given Maria written authority to act in his place. I
protested, but there was no choice. I remember it as it was yesterday.

&nbsp;

�Young man � follow
me� He went over to a door. When he opened it, I saw an odd piece of furniture.
Seeing my surprise he explained. �This is a spanking trestle. I need you to
drop your clothes and lie down it.�

&nbsp;

I blushed. I have not
undressed in front of another woman but my mother. I hesitated but Mr. Skinner
told me that the number of strokes would be doubled if I did not get started. 

&nbsp;

When I was naked Mr.
Skinner made me lie down on the trestle. First my hands and feet were put in
leather cuffs. Then they put a leather strap over my body, so I could not move.
Finally a wide leather collar was put around my neck and fastened with two
D-rings to the trestle. The collar made me keep my head up, I looked straight
forward.

&nbsp;

�Young man: You are
going to count the strokes. If you fail, we would start over.� He waived at
Maria.

&nbsp;

For a moment the room
was so quiet that we could have heard a pin drop. I began to sweat. What is she
waiting for? I tried to turn my head, but it was impossible due to the
collar.� Then the stroke came. It was
almost a relief, but then I felt the warmed. I tried to shake the pain off, but
it was impossible. Then I remembered. If the stroke should count, I had to do
the counting myself.

&nbsp;

�One�

&nbsp;

The room was silent.
Again I endured the torture of the wait. Without notice the second stroke hit
me. The pain went through my body as waives. I managed to regain control.

&nbsp;

�Two�

&nbsp;

I was about to catch
my breath, when third stroke hit me. It was to fast. It caught me off guard. I
let out a small cry. But I managed to stammer �Three�.

&nbsp;

Just as I had said it,
the fourth stroke came. It made me sob. I pulled at the restraint but it was of
no use. She had broken me. With a low voice I said:

&nbsp;

�Four�

&nbsp;

I continued to sob a
little, but then I noticed that Mr. Skinner just looked at me with disgust.
Then I felt it. My member had turned hard. As I tried to look him the eye, the
final stroke came. She must have used all her force, because I hurt a lot more
than the previous strokes. With a sobbing voice I managed to confirm the last
blow.

&nbsp;

�Five�

&nbsp;

Maria came over to me
and kneeled beside me. �Poor darling: No one has disciplined you and taken care
of you since the death of your mother. But rest assure. Now I am here for you.
I can see that you are confused and in fact have been reaching out for a firm hand.�
I felt that she touched my member. �You liked to be disciplined. You have in
fact missed it.� Mr. Skinner nodded to Maria and left the room. She rose and
went behind me. Then she commanded me �Open your mouth!�

&nbsp;

When I did she pulled
some leather hood down over my head. There were openings for the mouth and
eyes. Inside there was a gag-ball, which went into my mouth. She laced the hood
tight and then she attached two leather pieces over my eyes and my mouth. I was
in total darkness. She continued to touch me various places. Just I was about
to explode, I felt something being tightened around the base of my scrotum.

&nbsp;

What now? Suddenly I
felt something cold on my buttocks. It was something which felt nice as she
smeared it out over my warm and still hurting behind.

&nbsp;

When she was finished,
she turned her attention to my member again. She squeezed my ball softly and I
moaned into my gag. I so wanted release. My breathing was heavy. And my balls
began to hurt due to excitement. It seems to on forever. Then she realized my
member. I came. It was so good. Of course I had played with myself before. But
this was nothing compared to this. It is unbelievable. The flow seemed to go on
forever. Then I pass out.

&nbsp;

When I came around the
hood and Maria was gone and I was released. Mr. Skinner was back in the room. 

�Young man: Put your
clothes on again. I feel it as this kind of punishment is a waste on you but I
have to warn you that the number of strokes would double next time. So behave.�

&nbsp;

The rest of the day
went on without incidents. When I returned home Maria was cleaning and she
acted as the episode at school had never taken place. My father popped in when
he returned home late and told me that the use of corporal punishment was one
of the reasons, he enrolled me at this school.

&nbsp;

Time went by and I
took my schoolwork serious. Of course Maria�s treatment was nice, but not worth
having your butt spanked 10 times with the board.

&nbsp;

Then a year ago Maria
received a phone call from home which made her cry. My father, who was home for
a change, talked to her and learned that her mother had died. He comforted her
and told me to order a pizza for myself, because he was going to take Maria out
for lunch out of pity for her.

&nbsp;

They left and I
enjoyed my pizza. It was almost like the old days. I stole a couple of beers
from the fridge and had a really good time before I went to sleep.

&nbsp;

The next morning I
went by my father�s bedroom and saw them sleeping together. I was shocked and
torn apart. She was going after us both. Could I tell my father? Would he
believe me?

&nbsp;

14 days later they
married quietly. It was just us three and the minister.

&nbsp;

First our lives
continued to go on as before. I went to high school after graduating from the
Christian school but did not have any plans after that. I was thinking of
getting a job to let time go until I had found out what to do. Maria did as she
used to do � without the maid uniform of course.

&nbsp;

But slowly she began
to make demands. They wanted me to do some chores, but were this not what Maria
came here for. The next months were one fight after another. Just last weekend
we were fighting over beers missing from the garage. I was me that had stolen
them, but father had never bothered to complain about it. But Maria interfered
in everything at our house. I hated her.

&nbsp;

And now the news about
my father on the top of it all � it was almost too much. My teacher took me
down to the street where a cab waited for me to take me to the hospital. On
arrived I ran into to the E.R. only to be greeted by a Maria dissolved from
tears. 

&nbsp;

�Oh. Rick. It is too
late. His car broke down on the highway and before he could get out, he was hit
by a truck. He is dead.� She began to cry.

&nbsp;

The next weeks went on
as it was a nightmare. The funeral was awful. Now it was just Maria and me. I
was spending all day lying in bed. I did not want to do anything. I had lost
both my parents. My life seemed to be at end.

&nbsp;

2. Holiday

&nbsp;

One day Maria entered
my room. She wanted to talk to me. 

&nbsp;

�Rick. What about your
future? When you become 18 you will get control over your parent�s money and it
is a small fortune.� What would you do
for a living?�

&nbsp;

�I will move out to a
small apartment � buy a new car and basically enjoy life.�

�That is totally
irresponsible.�

&nbsp;

�That is my choice.
Next year I will be 18 and then you have seen the last of me.�

&nbsp;

�Why do you hate me?�

&nbsp;

�Because you first
played with me and later with my father - I don�t trust you.�

&nbsp;

She left the room. 

&nbsp;

A week later she
popped in again. �Rick. I have been thinking. What about us two taking a
holiday down to Mexico,
where we can enjoy life on the beach? I know that things have not been good
between us lately, but take this offer as a kind of a kind of apology of my
lack of understanding about the impact that your fathers death had on you. Of
course you should be allowed to mourn, but I think that you also should
recognize that life - as hard as it is - goes on.�

&nbsp;

I agreed. After all it
had been a month where I barely had left my room. After she had left, I stood
up and looked at myself in the mirror. I had neglected my body. Numerous pizzas
and soft drinks had left traces on my body. I must be at least 15 pounds overweight.
Well, I had to exercise a little during the holiday.

&nbsp;

Fourteen days later I
was sitting in the car next to Maria, who was driving. When we had crossed the
border, Maria started to talk about her family. She had been born in California, but most of her family lived in Mexico.
She wanted to drop in on a social visit with her cousin Hector. I did not mind.
An hour later we stopped in front of a large building. 

&nbsp;

�Large house your
cousin live in.�

&nbsp;

Maria nodded but did
not answer. As we entered the house, we came to some kind of reception and a
man come over to us and immediate embraced Maria. �Maria!�

&nbsp;

Maria presented us.
�Rick. This is my cousin Hector Gonzarles. Hector. This is Rick Normann.�

&nbsp;

We went into some kind
of office, where two strong looking staff members sat in some chairs.� Something was wrong here. I began to be
nervous. Once inside Maria turned to me. �By the way: This is your new boarding
school.�

&nbsp;

�My
what!!!�

&nbsp;

�Your
new boarding school. In
fact is a motivation boot camp where children like you, who for some reason has
come to a stop when it comes to living, can regain motivation and experience
emotional growth. Hector. You can take it from here.�

&nbsp;

�Welcome to Herbaceous
Perennial Learning Center (HPLC) - Rick Norman. As you should have guessed
by now, I am the director of this facility. We have already arranged for your
high school papers to be transferred here and it seems that we have so little
time to get so much done. Please follow these two staff members so you can get
your school uniform on.�

&nbsp;

I tried to pull back,
but they grabbed me under my shoulders and carried me out of the office. We can
to a bathroom where I was told to undress. When I was naked they showed me over
to a trestle similar to the one I had been spanked on at the school. They could
see how nervous I was. 

&nbsp;

�Relax � senor. We are
not going to hurt you, but you have to be cleaned totally before you can enter
the school. Please lie down on the trestle.� For the second time in my life I
was strapped down on a spanking trestle. Every minute I expected Maria to enter
through the door ready to spank me. But instead they pulled a leather hood over
my head. It was the same type Maria had used on me when I was younger. The
openings for eyes and mouth were closed when the hood was laced.

&nbsp;

I was lying in
darkness and did not know what to expect. Suddenly I felt pain in my rear. They
had put something inside me! Then I felt something to flow inside me. It was
some kind of fluid. Very soon it became unpleasant. The fluid began to press
against my guts. It hurt! I tried to shout but the gag made it impossible. To
make matter worse the ball gag inside the hood was hollow so I began to drool
without control.

&nbsp;

I tried to wrist and
hurt a little so the pain could be a little more manageable. Then I noticed.
The flow had stopped. I felt that they removed the nozzle. Instead something
cold was applied. Suddenly a sharp pain came from my sphincter. Something big
was about to enter me. At once I screamed into the gag and tried to pull at the
restraints, but I could not move. Suddenly it slipped inside. A shock went
through my body. The discomfort was intense.

&nbsp;

Once inside it seemed
to grow for some seconds, then it stopped. I could not spill the fluid they had
put inside me and I so needed to go to the bathroom. I
tried to let them free me. I pleaded, sobbed, cried, but the hood and the gag
made it impossible. The pain increased and it felt like my stomach was going to
explode. It was unbearable. I lost consciousness.

&nbsp;

When I woke the hood
was off and I was no longer restrained.

&nbsp;

�Senor. Come with us.�

&nbsp;

When I rose from the
trestle, the stomach cramp started again. I sank to my knees with grunt.

&nbsp;

�Just try to follow us
so you can go to a toilet.�

&nbsp;

When I waddle over to
the toilet, I notice a tube with a pump hanging out from my behind. One of the
staff members took rubber gloves on and told me to position myself over the
toilet. Then he pressed something on the pump and I felt something deflate
inside me. With a quick move he pulled whatever they had put inside me out
which was a little painful. I began to empty my guts. I was so good.

&nbsp;

I was told to sit down
in a chair where they restrained me once more with straps. Then they shaved my
head including my eyebrows. I looked like a monster when they were finished. I
sobbed. This was not a school, it was a torture camp. Finally they let me
shower.

&nbsp;

They took me to
another room for school uniform. Inside there were cuffs hanging down from the
ceiling. Soon I was wearing them and they hoisted me in the air just so my feet
did not touch the ground. I was blindfolded again. I felt them wrapping
something around my waist. Then they pulled at it so I felt they were cutting
me in half. I protested but they did not care. Eventually they were finished
and I was lowered to the floor. The next thing they applied was a collar which
forced me to look straight and a little up. It was connected with a strap to
the waist belt. I felt them put a leather piece over my member. I hurt a little
when they pulled it tight. My hands were freed only to be put into other cuffs,
which was connected to the waist belt, so my arm was immobilized along my body.� 

&nbsp;

They told me to bend
over, which caused pain because the waist belt cut into my skin. One staff
member held me while the other inserted something in my behind. Because they
had stretched my sphincter before I did not hurt so much. The blindfold was
removed and they showed me over to a mirror.

What a bizarre look.
My waist was compressed by a wide waist clincher with a large strap going up to
the wide collar. There were D-rings several places on the clincher where each
of my arms were fastened two cuffs at both upper- and lower arms. My genitals
were covered by a leather pieces and some kind of rubber tail was hanging down
from my behind. As I stood there with a surprise look on my face one of the
staff members forced a rubber bit into my mouth.

&nbsp;

They followed me back
to the office were Maria and Gonzales waited. Maria was happy.

&nbsp;

�That certainly
improved your posture and waistline. I am going to leave you know and return
when my cousin reports of progress. I will personally see to that you get a
proper education. That I have promised your father.
Bye for now�. She left.

&nbsp;

I sobbed. She had told
me that we were going on holiday and then she just dump me here as a kind of
slave.

3. Peer group

&nbsp;

Gonzales interrupted
my sobbing. �Rick. Listen to me. You have no choice but to stay here. Maria is
your legal guardian for almost a year before you becomes an adult. If you
manage to escape, Maria would go to the police and report you as a runaway, so
you will be arrested if you manage to enter the States and then you will spend
time in the juvies.�

&nbsp;

�B..�
The gag made my speaking unintelligible.

&nbsp;

�No but! I am now
going to explain your stay here. You will join a peer group as Mule. We have three
levels in our program: Mules, Miners and Mentors. You will be Mule for two
weeks before you can stand up at group therapy on Fridays and apply for the
next level. Mules don�t talk unless we are in group therapy; Mules are gagged
and tied to the carts during work and escorted by Miners or Mentors outside
work guided by a harness. Every morning you will get an enema so you don�t need
a visit to the toilet in order to do number two. If you feel the need to pee,
just do it on the ground. That part of your harness will be cleaned from time
to time. Please follow the staff-member.�

&nbsp;

One of the
staff-members came over and connected a leash at each side of the bit. He
pulled and I had no choice but to follow him like a �. a
mule!�

&nbsp;

We walked outside
where I saw that is was come kind of gravel business. There must have been
about 100 teenagers in action. Half of them were pulling cart dressed like me.
Others were busy with shovels filling the carts and a few students went around
nursing and overseeing the others.

&nbsp;

A group of 5 teenagers
stopped to work, when we approached. The staff-member introduced me. �This is
Rich � you new mule. Rich: This is peer group 8, from Left: Ashley � Mentor, Bill � Miner, Jack
� Miner, Vanessa � Miner, Tina � Mule, Bianca � Mule. Ashley: Please take over
from here.�

&nbsp;

The staff-member left.
Ashley took the word. �Miners: Group hug.� They all came over and hugged me.
�Rick. You will be OK. We will look after you during your path towards
healing.�

&nbsp;

Ashley took me over to
a cart. In fact it was a converted bicycle trailer with two poles going from
it. I was placed between them and hooked on to it with chains going from both
the cuffs and waist clincher. �Look Rick. The cart will be filled with gravel
by one of the miners. It is 50-70 kilos you have to pull. You have to take it
up to the top where another group will empty it. It is hot and I am going to
look at you every time you return in order to check if you need water. We work
the whole afternoon with breaks every second hour until 6 p.m. but try to
forget about the time. There is no clock anyway. Follow me and just be
cooperative. I have to tell you that I have to use the whip on you if you don�t
work. I don�t like it. In fact it will hurt me as much as it will hurt you, but
it will be for your own best.�

&nbsp;

She pulled me over to
Vanessa who started to shovel gravel into the cart. When she signed me that I
finished I tried to pull the cart. It would not move. Vanessa gave it a push
and it began to move. I stopped again and now I could not move it. Ashley came
over. �Once you have got it in motion, do not stop unless you have no choice.
You have obvious neglected your body but we will see to that we fix it. Let me
help you a little.� She pushed it and I got going again. It was hard and I was
about to slow down again when Ashley, who obviously had followed me intervened.
�No you don�t.� Then I felt a lash from her whip on my left buttock. She
continued to follow me all the way. Once I arrived other miners emptied the
cart and I went back to my own peer group. 

&nbsp;

All afternoon went by
doing the same. The cart was filled. I pulled it up from the gravel pit. The
cart was emptied. Ashley only followed me the first time. She checked on me as
she checked the other mules every time I returned to the team. Inside I was
crying and angry. Why had Maria done this to me? I did not deserve it. I had
lost my parents. Should I not be allowed to grieve for them?

&nbsp;

It was sunset when we
heard a whistle, which signaled that the work was over. We all left the gravel
pit. The miners release us and guided us over to showers, which was placed
outside the building. First they went under. It was not much of a shower, we
were allowed. Only about 30 seconds showering before it was out again. Then
they took us under the shower. We did not even get the outfit off. We showered
with out clothes on! I had been sweating so much that I barely got wet because
it almost steamed off me.

&nbsp;

After showering, the
miners dried us with towels and we was guided into a large dining hall and placed
at a table with the number of our peer group on. The miners unhooked our cuffs
and the bit came out. I was sore in my cheeks, so it took a little before I
could talk. I turned towards Vanessa and presented myself. Ashley came over at
once. �No talking. You are a Mule. You are only allowed to talk during group
therapy. Shut up at once or the bit will be replaced with a tube gag, so you
have to drink your dinner.� 

&nbsp;

She meant business, no
question about that. Dinner was some odd mix containing chicken. Ashley and the
miners talked. As I could understand from their conversation, they were here
because they had partied without permission from their parents or having
trouble with rules in the house. Vanessa spoke to me. �Rick. You are not
allowed to talk, so I am just going to say to you that I think you did well
today. Yes, I can see that you are sad but forget this self-pity. You are here
by your own actions and there is only one person, who can get you out. It is
you, so grab a hold of yourself and start to reflect on why you victimize
yourself.�

&nbsp;

After dinner it was
time for education. First Ashley took me to the bathroom where the butt-plug,
as they called the thing in my behind, was removed. Then she followed me to a
class-room.

&nbsp;

Ashley took me to a
computer. �Here is your workstation. All the school papers from your school
have been transferred here and you are now a distance student at your old
school. I can see that you have neglected your school work for a long time, so
you just have to get on with it. The others have time on their own, which they
have earned by hard work. You have to show results, before you can earn free
time. So get on with it. I will get you in two hours.� She left.

4. Group Therapy

&nbsp;

Two hours later she
returned. �It is time for the last item on this day�s agenda � group therapy.
Follow me.�

&nbsp;

We came inside a small
room where all waited.

&nbsp;

Once I was seated they
started by standing one by one and present themselves. Ashley started. 

&nbsp;

�I am Ashley and I
have been a good girl for 20 days.� One by one they stood up and told how many
days they had been either good boys or good girls. The last one was Bianca. �I
am Bianca and I have been a good girl for 4 days.�

&nbsp;

Then they all looked
at me without saying a word. The whole situation was bizarre. 5 people looking
as they just had stepped down on earth from a spaceship all shaved like me in
equally odd costumes (The only difference was that the girls had a corset on
which covered their breasts.) all looked as I was going to say some wise words.
I slowly stood up. 

&nbsp;

�I am Rick and I guess
that I have been a good boy for one day.� I could see a mix of satisfaction and
relief in their eyes. It must have been the right thing to say.

&nbsp;

Ashley took the word
again. �Today we are addressing dependence. I will start and then I would say
the name of the person, who will take over from here. I was depended on my
appearance, but since my parents send me here because I used my mother�s 200
dollar Chanel perfume, dropped one of her earrings into the sink and billed my
hairdo on their credit card, I have learned that it does not mean so much how I
looked. Jack � you are next.�

&nbsp;

�I have pretty much
accepted that I depended being a part of the geek group back in high school.
Instead of partying like the rest of my classmates, I spend the afternoons
studying. I even went to school without thinking of the fact stripped shirt
does not mix with a check pattern tie.�

&nbsp;

The other looked at
him in disbelief. He gesticulate an apology. �Sorry. I simply did not think
that it was so important, but I have learned of my mistake. I did not know how
much I was about to hurt myself by isolating myself in that way. Rick. It is
your turn.�

&nbsp;

�I have just arrived
here today and I don�t know anything that I have been depended of. I very much
just did my school work and lived like any other students. Maria � my stepmom �
has sent mere here after my father died, because she does approve of my plans
for the future. I guess that I just have to survive here until I am 18, which
is some 11 months away, because me being sent here is her doing � not mine.
Bianca. You are next.�

&nbsp;

Ashley stopped me.
�Not so fast. All people in this world have something they are depended of. You
are no exception. I got some notes from Mr. Gonzales and I think that you are
depended of being a victim.�

&nbsp;

�What? You are joking�

&nbsp;

�Try to follow me for
a second. First your mother dies. You throw yourself in the arms of your
schoolteacher and father so you don�t have to do anything because they are
supposed to feel sorry for you. It works for a while and your father hires a
housekeeper. Then he dies and you just sit in your room expecting your step-mom
to clean your behind and nurse you. Life goes on � man! You are so buried in
grief that you do it because you like it.�

&nbsp;

�You are so wrong. I
lost my parents and you think that I find pleasure from it.�

&nbsp;

�I think that I have a
point. Vanessa: Tell him why.�

&nbsp;

Vanessa stood up. �I
was depended of being felt sorry for because I was molested when I was five
years old. I hated it but eventually I discovered that I could benefit from all
people being sorry for me. My parents bought me all sort of things out of guilt
because they had not looked after me properly, but I guess that all good things
come to an end, because one day they decided to send me here, because it would
have been too expensive to take me with them on a cruise ship with so much they
could buy for me. So they are in Europe and I
am here. But don�t misunderstand me. I am grateful for them sending me here,
because deep inside I was squeezed by all their pity
for me.�

&nbsp;

�There you see. I
think that we have spelled it out for you, but someone needs more motivation
than others. What does the group say?�

&nbsp;

They all chanted �The
chair. He must do the chair.�

&nbsp;

They all rose and held
me. Ashley put a blindfold on me. Then I was guided across them room.

&nbsp;

�Now Rick! Sit down
carefully.�

&nbsp;

They all held me while
I lowered myself down on the chair. Suddenly I felt something cold against my
sphincter. �Relax Rick - It is a dildo. Just continue to lower yourself slowly.
We don�t want to call for the guard � right?�

&nbsp;

I thought that I had
no choice. Rather do it slowly than the staff members jamming it up into me by
force. So I lowered myself. Luckily a whole day with a plug had made my muscles
ease a little. But it was big! I gasped several times and had to stop before
continuing. It seemed to be forever before I reached the seat. They strapped me
to the chair with several straps securing me very firmly to the chair. I could
not move an inch. The blindfold was removed.

&nbsp;

�We are going to have
a 15 minute break where you will have possibility to meditate quietly. I think
that you are familiar with this kind of leather hood.� She showed me an
isolation hood like the one I had tried before and pulled it down over my head.
After they had laced it tight, I felt that they applied a couple of straps over
it, so I could not move my head. I was in total darkness and could barely hear
anything. Just remote noises reached me. I tried to position myself. Then
suddenly it happened. The dildo began to move up and down!!

&nbsp;

First with a very slow
pace, then it increased its pace. It became hot inside my rectum as the
lubrication stopped to work. I wanted to move away but couldn�t. I grunted and
groan due to the pain. It hurt more. It was like they had put a red-hot metal
bar up in my ass. It burned. I sobbed and cried inside the hood. The inside of
the hood was wet from tears. I began to scream from pain. I had never been
exposed for such a pain before. Not even the spanking I received from Maria did
hurt so much. Suddenly another feeling began to mix with the unbearable pain.
My member had turned hard inside its leather prison or at least tried to. I
could not control myself. Suddenly a flow of semen began to flow from my penis.
It was as it was remote controlled. It just kept on pumping and pumping semen
out.

&nbsp;

I had never
experienced that kind of a relief. There was no real pleasure � it only felt like
when you have been waiting too long in a line for a toilet. The dildo continued
its pace. The pain stopped. It was as I was numb in my behind. I had lost track
of time. When will I be released?

&nbsp;

Suddenly the dildo
stopped. The hood came off and I saw them standing in circle around me. �Did
you learn something?�

&nbsp;

I cried. �It was so
painful. You must have torn my behind apart.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, pain like losing
a parent, but was there not just a fraction of pleasure in it.�

&nbsp;

Dissolved with tears I
nodded.

&nbsp;

�There you see. You
have enjoyed being a victim and someone to care about. You did not see it
because you were filled with self-pity. I think we can release him now. Help me
by lifting him up slowly.�

&nbsp;

The straps came off
and they helped me on my feed. �Oh. There is blood on the dildo. We need
antiseptic lubricant.� Vanessa took a latex glove and smeared something cold on
to my sphincter. The sphincter seemed to have its own life. Opening and closing
without control. �Rick. We have to put a small butt-plug into you for the night
because of the treatment. Try to relax.�

&nbsp;

�It is easy for you to
see. You have torn me apart.� I sobbed, because the feeling in my behind came
back and it was very painful, but they managed to slip the plug into place. I
was escorted back to my seat where I was able to sit down with a lot of pain.

&nbsp;

�Rick. Who is next?�

&nbsp;

�Bianca.�

&nbsp;

�I have learned to
value ordinary work. I had studied various courses on the university but I
never found pleasure in any work and despite the fact that I comes from a
family with a long tradition of going to the states to serve as maids, I kind
of looked down on that kind of work. You can say that I was so depended of the
surroundings of a life as a student, that I could not make the transformation
from school to real life. Despite the fact that the director is my uncle, I
like this experience. Tina: You are next.�

&nbsp;

We continued to hear
about dependencies from the others. Then it was time for those, who wanted to
graduate to the next level, to stand up and speak their case. None stood up.
Ashley turned to Tina. �Tina. You are getting comfortable again. You don�t work
the program. You have to Monday to stand up and demand to graduate to miner or
you will suffer consequences.�

&nbsp;

Deep inside I wondered
what kind of consequences they could use on her. She was already in the bottom
in the hierarchy. The therapy session was over and it was time to go to bed, so
I did not get an answer to my question.

&nbsp;

Because I was a mule I
had to sleep with the other mules on the ground in a building with only hay as
a kind of mattress. I could not sleep.

&nbsp;

A lot of questions
came to me. How could I escape this insane place? If Maria was Gonzales cousin,
did she know Bianca who obvious was a relative? What kind of consequences could
they use on me if I decided to just wait for my birthday so I could walk out
free? Was I enjoying being someone people had pity for?

&nbsp;

Finally I feel asleep.

5. Not working the program

&nbsp;

I had been at the
facility for a week, when Gonzales came in the room, while we were having a
group therapy session. He addressed me.

&nbsp;

�Rick. Ashley has
informed me, that you are not working the program. You don�t take the word during
therapy sessions enough. Your contribution to the session is small remarks from
time to time. So I am putting you on a challenge as a consequence. Maria has
asked me to pay special attention to you because you are such a person, who
could choose just to wait until you are an adult instead of healing yourself.
The challenge starts tomorrow and we are not going to inform you of the nature
of the challenge.� He left after this attack.

&nbsp;

Bianca gave me a
remark. �Challenges are tough. Now I feel pity for you. Ironic, is it not?�

&nbsp;

The next morning we
lined up. Somehow I had forgotten about the challenge when a guard came over to
Ashley carrying a bag. Suddenly I saw how nervous the mules became. Some of
them sobbed and Bianca had tears running down her cheeks.

&nbsp;

Ashley took me over to
the cart and I was connected normally. Then they removed the leather piece,
which covered my genital. I blushed when I stood exposed in front of almost all
the mules. 

&nbsp;

Ashley noticed my
embarrassment. �Relax Rick. Soon you will have other things to worry about than
a couple of people seeing you naked.� She took a couple of latex gloves for her
hands and then she grabbed some leather piece from the bag. With one hand she
squeezed around the base of my scrotum while she wrapped the piece around it
with the other hand. It could be tightened by a small strap. She tightened it
all it could and it was a little painful.

&nbsp;

�So now the ball
stretcher is secured. Give me the other things.�

&nbsp;

The guard gave her a weight.
She hooked it on to a small ring at the bottom of the stretcher. When she let
go of the weight, my balls was pulled down hard. My member stood out in all its
pride despite the added weight.

&nbsp;

Ashley stood up. �We
have to make sure people can hear you when you are on your way today, because
you will have difficulties carrying the weight after an hour or two. The others
are aware of your challenge and they will be aware of you due to the sound of
the bells and move to the side so you can pass.� She had just finished her
sentence when I for the first time in my life felt the pain from a nipple
clamp. I sunk to my knees. It felt as she had stuck a knife into me. I cried
from pain. Ashley turned to the staff member �Can I get a bigger bit for his
mouth?� When the bit came out, I tried to plead with her. �Ashley. Look I will
participate for real.� She did not believe me. �You are trying to manipulate
me.� The new bit was inserted. It was so big that my jaws were sore within a
minute. Ashley put the other nipple clamp on. I jumped on the spot from the
pain. It was so intense. For a minute I thought that I was going to pass out.

&nbsp;

�Now move. It is time
for work.� When I took the first step, I learned that I had to walk slowly
because the weight began to swing which pain as result. There were bells
connected to the clamps and a ringing sounded wherever I came.

&nbsp;

An hour later I sank
to my knee due to the weight. Ashley came over and gave me one lash on my
buttock after another. She called Bill and he helped me up. �Man. You have to
be strong. Go on. You can do it.� He followed me the rest of the day. I thought
that I was going to loose my balls. It hurt so much. 

&nbsp;

Then the whistle
sounded. When I was release from the cart. Bill removed the clamps. I fell to
the ground. It hurt even more having them removed than having them put on. In
the last second he managed to see to that I did not hit the ground too hard. I
came up on my feet again. The stretcher seemed to be a problem. My member was
almost blue from being treated like this all day. Bill called Maris � a girl
from another peer group, who was on a speaking challenge. Instead of a bit-gag,
they had put a tube-gag on her. They made her kneel in front of me and then
they force me forward so my penis entered the tube. It almost made her choke once
it was totally inside her. It was nice having her lick my penis, even tough she
could only use her tongue because of the gag.

&nbsp;

Bill released my
scrotum and I came in her mouth at once. First she coughed from all the semen
but then she started to drink it.

&nbsp;

Once all the semen had
disappeared inside her mouth I was lead over to the showers and the leather
piece came on again.

&nbsp;

At the group therapy
session Ashley told me if I had learned something from my challenge.

&nbsp;

�Yes, I thought that I
would die. I have never experienced such a pain. But somehow I managed with
help from Bill, which I would thank him for. I now believe that I can graduate
the program and I will make an effort.�

&nbsp;

Tina replied �I it
funny how everything that does not kill you, makes you stronger. I also thought
that I would die in this program and spent very much the first weeks on my
knees crying, but Ashley�s whip and the electric nipple clamps learned me how
to meat a challenge head on. Now I will also will do my best to graduate this
program and re-earn the trust of my family, which I had let down so completely
by using a bicycle without wearing helmet. I am glad that they sent me here due
to my rule-violation regarding setting safety first.�

&nbsp;

The others told me
about challenges, which is used on mules, because they can�t be dumped to a
lower level for a rule violation. They all agreed that the challenge Daniel
from peer group 11 got, because he constantly was trying to escape, was the
most severe. It was a seeing / running challenge. All day he hat to work with
an isolation hood on. He was constantly guide by a miner, which had him on a
leash and gave him water through a straw. The but-plug was twice the normal
size. He could only take small steps because they had given him leg-irons on and
he was given a special cart, which could load up to 200 pounds. In fact the
cart was so heavy that he had an extra harness outside the normal one in order
to distribute the weight all over his body.

&nbsp;

When the normal work
stopped they took him up to a track field near the school where she inserted a
steel plug instead of the normal one. Still wearing leg-irons and with the
miner running next to him to ensure that he did not fall they connected the
leash to a four-wheeled bike and dragged him round the field for an hour before
releasing him.

&nbsp;

When he was release
that evening the harness had cut into his flesh and he had to be in his bed for
two days while his wounds healed. After this day he did not try to escape
anymore.

&nbsp;

In the end Ashley
stood up and told us that she was leaving tonight. In fact her parents were
already waiting for her in the reception. Her last duty was to appoint Jack as
the new mentor for the group. We all hugged before she left. I never saw Ashley
again, but to this day I thank her for the lessons she told me, regardless of
the fact that they were given me in such a cruel manner.

6. Trust

&nbsp;

After 3 weeks I stood
up and applied for permission to move up to the next level. But Jack had a
surprise for me.

&nbsp;

�Today�s issue is
trust. Have any of you ever failed the trust your parents had in you? That is
the question, you have to ask yourself and tell us about. I will start. I
misused the trust my parents had in me by using my father�s aftershave. Hygiene
products are personal product. It borders to stealing. I have learned this by
being sent here.�

&nbsp;

Vanessa was next: �I
misused my parents trust by not overcoming the molestation without demanding
too many physical things. In a way I used their guilt to ask for gifts
constantly.�

&nbsp;

Bianca: �I misused my
parents trust by not accepting who I am and where I came from. I denied my
origin and hurt my family in the process.�

&nbsp;

They looked at me, so
I gave them something. �I misused the trust of my father by not use all the
possibilities his tax-dollars gave me regarding education.�

&nbsp;

Jack was not
satisfied. �But do you not forget something.�

&nbsp;

I was a big question
mark.

&nbsp;

Jack gave me a photo.
�This photo came from your step-mom. It is from the surveillance video in your
garage. What is it that you have in your hand?�

&nbsp;

I was shocked. My
father had installed a camera in the garage and I was caught red-handed with a
beer in my hand. �It..it is a beer.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, it is a beer and
you are underage. Not only are you stealing from your own father. You are
breaking the law because alcohol is something to enjoy when you are over 21. Talk
about misuse of trust. Here in the group we are tired of your half-hearted
effort to follow the program. You have to be honest with us. What does the
group think?�

&nbsp;

Vanessa stood up. �I
think the chair would be appropriate.�

&nbsp;

Bianca joined her and
she was crying. �We believed in you and you let us down.� Then she sat down and
began to sob without control.

&nbsp;

The other gave the
same kind of remarks.

&nbsp;

Jack had his own idea.
I think that a challenge is the best solution in this case. They all nodded.

&nbsp;

The next morning I was
guided out with the other mules but nothing could prepare me for the contents
of this challenge. Once again I was presented with the isolation hood. But
before they put it on Jack revealed what kind of challenge I was put on.
�Because thirst seems to bring dishonesty out in you, you are put on a
challenge which involves drinking.� Then they put the hood on me. To my
surprise there was no gag-ball inside. Instead they asked me to open my mouth
and I felt some kind of tube enter my mouth. Once the hood was laced tight they
forced me down on my knees.

&nbsp;

Then something was
forced inside the tube. It was some kind of meat. It was warm and tasted bad.
My tongue investigated the object. It was a penis!! I tried to shake my head,
but they held me tight. I knew from my self that having your penis locked in
behind the leather piece for so long without relief meant that only a slight
touch would result in a hard-on and orgasm within minutes, so I tried to avoid
touching his penis with my mouth. Then he pushed the penis all in. I coughed as
it touched the back of my mouth. I could taste pre-cum and tried to fight him
of but instead more persons held me tight.

&nbsp;

Suddenly semen filled
my mouth. I could almost not breathe. I coughed. Finally the flow stopped. But
less than a minute after he extracted his penis, a new one was jammed in. They
can�t mean this! But they continued to hold very tight, so I had no choice and
the new guy was so aroused that he came almost at once. I had to drink it. It
made me almost throw up, but somehow it entered my stomach. The next penis came
in and after that the next one. I lost both numbers and track of time.

&nbsp;

Eventually I most have
serviced the last one because they pulled me up and guide me over a bed where
they helped to lie down on my back. They removed the blindfold and the gag on
the good and I found me being restrained on a kind of restraint bed in a
six-point restraint. 

&nbsp;

Suddenly one of the
female mules climbed on to the bed and positioned her lower parts at my mouth.
She lowered her body so I got her pussy was pressed down over my mouth. It
smelled and tasted like a fish which had not seen the ocean for a long time.
She rubbed her genitals against me and man was she wet. For how long had they
denied anyone access to her private parts? For how long had she like any of the
mules not had other means of personal hygiene than those 30 seconds of showers
every day?

&nbsp;

I had to play the
game. I had to use my tongue to get this over with. She became more and more
aroused. In the wet my hood was covered by her juices and she came screaming.
They helped her off the bed but she was replaced by a newcomer. She was big
almost to a point where I would call her obese. Obvious her parents had chosen
HPLC as a fat camp for her. I could barely breathe. Her smelly juices ran down
my throat. Finally it was enough for her and a new girl took her place. I did
not know how many girls I serviced. The last one to ride me was Bianca. I did
my best and I was very clear that she had needed such a treatment for a long
time. I brought her into heaven.

&nbsp;

Once I was freed they
help me out to the showers where I was given extra time so I could get all the
semen and juices off me. But being a month in HPLC made my uniform dirty beyond
any possibility of making it clean. It still smelled from a full month of
sweat. 

&nbsp;

When the group therapy
started I expected to be torn to pieces by the group. Instead Jack pronounced
that I was now a miner. My days pulling a cart with a bit-gag were over, but
Jack also warned me that I could loose my level if I did not progress on the
path towards healing.

7. Maria and Manuela

&nbsp;

A week later I was
shoveling gravel together with Bianca, who also had reached the level of miner,
when one of the staff members told us to go up to the main building. We were
nervous when we went inside because we were worried about what kind of
punishment we had earned.

&nbsp;

Instead to my big
surprise Maria and another woman was waiting for me. I hugged her. Regardless
of the fact that she had sent me here, she was all I had left. �Step back.
Rick. I want to see your waist line.� She looked me over and turned to Gonzarles, who was doing some deskwork. �I am truly
impressed. You have done so much good work with him.�

&nbsp;

�He has done it
himself. After a difficult start Rich has shown us that he deep inside wanted
to come here. He just needed to get out of his comfort zone.� 

&nbsp;

Bianca introduced me
to the other woman, which was her mother Manuela. Then Gonzarles
told us that today was a kind of home visit. We would go off campus until
tomorrow evening and spend it together with our relatives before returning to
the center in the evening.

&nbsp;

A staff member told us
to follow him. Together we were guided into a room where staff members helped
us out of her uniform and given a proper shower with soap. It was odd. Things
that I had regarded as a natural part of my daily life, was now luxury.

&nbsp;

However once I got the
uniform off I noticed that there was some wrong with my back. I was so used to
having it supported by the uniform that is exhausting to do without it. Bianca
had it the same way. The staff member offered us a normal corset we could wear
under our normal clothes. It was a bit odd because I was a boy but it helped
with my back.

&nbsp;

The women were waiting
for us when we came outside and we drove by the nearby town of San Mateo down to a town
called Rosarito, which was lying at the ocean.

&nbsp;

Here we booked into a
small motel and we ate dinner and toured the city. It was like the holiday I
original expected when Maria lured me down to Mexico. It was as HPLC did not
exist. The contrast between locked up in a camp and being able to walk freely
around in a city was indescribable. 

&nbsp;

In the evening Manuela
and Bianca went to their room for a talk about Bianca�s future. When they had
left, Maria asked me if I had an idea what to do after graduation. I had to confess
to her that I had doubts about my future. Maybe law was a possibility but I was
not sure. She had a suggestion.

&nbsp;

�I know that I can not
keep you here after you turn 18 and it was never my intension. I enrolled you
at HPLC because I would help you before you turn 18 and can decide to put your
life down the drain without anyone can do something about it. I needed
something to challenge you and you must have to admit that it had remolded and
turn-around your life.�

&nbsp;

I began to sob. �Yes,
but it had been so hard.�

&nbsp;

�I know, darling, but
some day I would not be around and then you will be in a bad situation, if you
had not received treatment so you still would have been locked inside your room
all day long.�

&nbsp;

I nodded. She was
right.

&nbsp;

�And I still don�t
think that you are ready to live of your own. I have an idea. One of the
school, HPLC received students from is located in Jamaica. It is called Meditation Inlet,
which just by the sound of the name would give you peace and quietness while
you decide in what line of business, you will work. Your high school credits
can be transferred, so you would be a distance student and additionally they
offer education in housekeeping. It would just what you need so you can live by
your own. What do you say?�

&nbsp;

�Meditation Inlet; It
sounds like a relaxed place. Yes, I will take your offer.�

&nbsp;

�OK. I will make Gonzarles arrange for a transfer, when he means you are
ready. Let�s go to sleep.�

&nbsp;

The next morning I got
a chance to talk with Bianca. I told her about my decision to go to Jamaica
and she also had news for me.

�I am going to a
Christian boarding school in Whitefish
  Lake, Montana. It is
called Sun Grove
Academy and is a girls-only boarding school, where they teach sincere
family life. It is something I need because we pretty much lived on take-out
food due to the irregular work hours of my parents. I have never made food,
washed the dishes or cleaned the house. Chores were something that I am
unfamiliar with and in order to be a good wedded wife, I have to learn it.�

&nbsp;

�It is the same with
me. It must be our modern society which makes people like us miss out of those
things. I remember that one of the teachers called our parents curling parents
because they sweep obstacles away from our path.�

&nbsp;

We continued to talk
and Bianca seemed to be a nice person. Wonder how she would look when her hair
once again would have grown. Due to the mandatory haircut, we still look like
victims of cancer.

&nbsp;

Late next day we drove
back. When we had said goodbye to Maria and Manuela outside the facility we
went inside where we once again was put in uniform. They had tried a sort of
dry-cleaning and even tough they still were smelly; they were not as unsavory
as we have left them.

&nbsp;

At group therapy we
were invulnerable. I could see envy in their eyes and if my eyes were anything
like Bianca�s they were glowing. The more I look at Bianca the better she
looks. What a shame that we are going to two several facilities

8. On to new adventures

&nbsp;

2 weeks later I was
supervising my peer group as mentor. Jonas - a new mule � had difficulties and during the day I had to use the whip on him several
times. Every lash hurt me as bad I think it hurt him, but he needed it. For
some reason he never touch vegetables and out of genuine concern about his
heath, his parents had sent him here. 

&nbsp;

Work was over and we
were on our way to the showers when suddenly the devil took him and he began to
run like hell towards an open gate. It was a kind of stupid because he still
had cuffs and the bit in his mouth. I was about to run after him, when a staff
member stopped me. �Let him run. Take care of the rest of your peer group and
we will get him with the car. It is a four-wheeled and the nearest house is 3 miles away. They get
money to phone us, whenever they sight a runner.�

&nbsp;

The staff-member was
of course right. Where should he go looking like that?

&nbsp;

When the rest of my
peer group was eating I was in the car with the staff member looking for Jonas.
It did not take us long to spot him trying to hide down in the valley. We
drover to him and he gave himself up, but to make sure that his escape did not
inspire others, we had to make an example of him. So while I held him tight the
staff member removed the leather piece, which covered his genitals. I watched
his tears when the spiked ball stretcher was put on. Then he got the nipple
clamps with the bells and we put a leash on his harness. We drove slowly back
to the camp with Jonas on the leash. I looked out the windows and made the
staff member stop every time he fell. Then I got out and helped him on his feet
again. I must have done it 3 or 4 times before we reached the camp. He had
bruises all over his body where he had hit the ground. After he had been
presented in front of all the mules he as an example for the others, my peer
group cleaned him up as good as possible.

&nbsp;

At group therapy he
tried to apologies to the group but we all meant that he didn�t sound truthful.
So we put him in the bedlam � a kind of casket which could be adjusted in
height so it was just his size. Inside there were straps for his legs, thighs,
waist, arms and head. He pleaded and sobbed while we were strapping him and
cried when we shut the lid. He had to lie in darkness until tomorrow when it
was time for group therapy, but every two hour a staff member would open a
small hatch in the casket and see to that he got something to drink. We could
hear him yelling from inside the casket when we left him. 

&nbsp;

It was kind of tragic.
He behaved like a wild animal which was caged for the first time. But in fact
it was not us who had decide to cage him. It was himself by his own actions.
Inside his mind he had the key to the casket and he did not know.

&nbsp;

The next he was very
quiet when we took him out - too quiet. He had stools down his legs. He must
have suffered from the runs, when we put him in. He just sat in his chair
swaying from one side to another. I was a little worried and we got him cleaned
before we called a doctor. He soon knew what was wrong. �He is gone to a place
most people don�t come back from.� 

&nbsp;

I was sorry but Gonzarles comforted me �You can not win them all.
Everything you did, was by the book. You see, he will
come around. We have a sister facility down the road where they can use him.
They run a kind of business where they print out business letters, put them in
envelopes and send them. You know mail-merging etc. They can have him sitting
in a chair all day long with a hollow gag-ball in his mouth so his drooling will
make it easy for them to use him as a manual postage meter. He will be fine.�

&nbsp;

So Jonas was shipped
off and Maggie came into our peer group instead. Thing seemed to go well, but
then it was time for me to leave. At the last group therapy session I appointed
Tina as the new mentor for the group. She had been here longer than me, but her
progress had been slower. However, she made it in the end and I was safe by
hand the group over to her.

&nbsp;

A staff member would
drive me to the airport and Gonzarles met me at the
door. I had so many things to thank this man for. He pulled me out in the world
from my self-imposed prison of grief.

9. Jamaica

&nbsp;

Several hours I was
standing on a private airstrip just across the border to the States. I went
over to a small office building and sat down a soft drink. The taste was from
heaven. I had missed it so much. Then a van came into the airfield. The sign on
the side said �Outsourced
Teenage Journey�. It had windows with plate glass. It stopped in front of
me and a staff member came out.

&nbsp;

�Rick Normann�

&nbsp;

�That is me�

&nbsp;

�I know that you are
here voluntary but our teen escort company has some guidelines to ensure safety
for our clients and especially the goods � youth like you, so I have asked you
to comply with my order even though they may seem a little exaggerated.�

&nbsp;

�I come directly from
HPLC, so you will not have problems with me.�

&nbsp;

�OK, then. I have to
ask you to wear this diaper. We have a long way to go and no time to use the
restroom.�

&nbsp;

I pulled my trousers
down and put on the diaper. Once I was done, I was asked to put my arms on my
back where he enclosed my arms in some sort of leather muff. There were straps
to two cuffs, which was placed on my upper arm. I could not move my arms. Then
he tightened two cuffs at my ankles. The final touch was a leather hood very
similar to the hoods they used at HPLC, but he did not put blindfold or
mouthpiece on. He opened the side door on the van and inside 3 people was
sitting on chairs in the back. Each person was chained to the floor with chains
going from the cuffs on the ankles to a hook in the floor. Additional they all
had seatbelts on. One of the people was adult, which I found a little odd. I
took a seat in the back next to one of the others and we took off. 

&nbsp;

In the other end of
the airstrip there was a plane waiting for us. I went on-board first. Once
inside I saw that the plane, which could accommodate 20 persons had similar
hook in the floor. I took a seat and watched the other being guided into their
seat and hooked up. Most of they had only a diaper on, so they had been fetched
directly from their bed. 10 minutes later a second van came and two other
youngsters dressed similar were followed on-board.

&nbsp;

Then the plane took
off. Once in the air, one of the staff members went around and removed the
mouthpiece of each individual in order to give them something to drink, before
he slipped the mouth piece in. Several of them were crying and pleading during
this ritual. When it was my turn, I asked him why there was an adult between
the youngsters. 

&nbsp;

�It is the family scare program,
where we by orders of the parent dress up as a kind of terrorist and make the
teenager believe that he or she together with one of his or her parents is
abducted for ransom. You can call it a kind of adventure trip, where the child
and parent are push to bond in order to resist the pressure from the outside �
in this case us, pushing them to the limit.�

&nbsp;

�Sounds odd�

&nbsp;

�It works very well
and although we use all the techniques from some of the more hard-hitting
programs like dog
cages, stone circles and Observation
Placement, the risk of impose traumatic experiences on the teenager is less
than in the original programs.�

&nbsp;

Several hours later we
landed in a private airport near Kingston
and the passengers were loaded into the back of a van. My arms began to be a
little sore, but opposite the other passengers I could enjoy the landscape. The
drive seemed to take forever. We passed numerous cities (Spanish
Town, Old
Harbor, Brazalitta,
Gunters Hill, Alligator Pond and Southfield) then the roads became bad and we
came to a small village near the ocean. 

&nbsp;

The guard spoke to me.
�Welcome to Treasure
 Bay, homes for some of
some of the most challenging boarding schools in the world.�

&nbsp;

When we passed through
a small village and then we saw a large campus with white walls around it. When
we approached the main gate, I saw the big sign. �Meditation Inlet �
Therapeutic Boarding School for Teens�
