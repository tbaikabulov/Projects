STUART�S SHAME

Stuart walked faster,
he knew that he couldn't slack. He passed a couple of guys he'd gone to
elementary and high school with, working on a car. They saw him, and snickered.
&quot;He has to be home or his uncle will spank him!&quot; one guy, Roddy, said to the other. &quot;No, not now, man...he's an
adult, it can't still be that way...remember when the uncle showed up that time
and made them strip to their skivvies?&quot; Stuart walked faster, feeling
embarrassed, as he always had. His mind flashed to Eli's pants being dragged
down in front of the other kids, and Uncle John's razor strop landing again and
again on Eli's defenseless buttocks.

&nbsp;

Stu&nbsp;could remember, as kids, just after coming to live with
Uncle John and Uncle Piet, he and Eli would test
their boundaries by hanging around after school, just to&nbsp;hang
around&nbsp;with the kids...ten minutes late was serious welts at home. But an
hour or more, and Uncle John would get in his old Ford and go out looking for
them! And swift, sure punishment would follow--if it hadn't been for the highschool sports teams--which the uncles approved of, as
it resulted in college scholarships,&nbsp;Stu would
never have played at all, just chores and studies.

&nbsp;

The cell phone vibrated in Stu's pocket as he finally reached his block, still walking
swiftly. &quot;Hello?&quot; &quot;Hi Stu, it's Brandi!&quot; Oh, that hottie
from the seminar, the Entrepreneurship Project Management girl who wears the
denim miniskirts. &quot;Hey, how did you get my number...I mean thanks for
calling!&quot; Stu babbled. She is such a hottie!&quot; &quot;The T.A. gave me your number, he said
you weren't supposed to give it out, but I seduced it out of him...you said
you'd help me with my graphs...and I thought I could make you dinner or somethin' you know?...You're such a mysterio...but
Dawn Hendrix from my Managerial Accounting class went to undergrad with
you...she told me stuff!&quot;

Was Dawn on the Tufts campus the day
that Uncle Piet took my pants down and whipped me
with his wooden hairbrush? God I hope not. He remembered kneeling with blazing
buttocks, his trousers around his knees, as the other students gaped at him,
while Piet's hands lambasted him in American Sign
Language for forgetting the dishes that morning. Nineteen years old. Wow!

&nbsp;

Stuart opened the door, listening to Brandi�s adorable
velvety tones coming through the cell phone. �Can we get together? Normally I
don�t have to ask guys twice. I have these economics questions to ask you�and
other things.� Her voice tinkled in his ear. �You never come out at night, Stu�and you rush home after classes.� Stu
gulped involuntarily. 

&nbsp;

He thought of
Uncle Pietro�s schedule. Piet
had a large sign-in sheet that they�d kept for him since elementary school. Stu had to sign in as soon as he got home from school�Piet and John had gauged the time it took for their nephew
to walk home from every school he�d ever been in, and currently it was a twenty
minute walk from the Harvard campus�and woe to Stu if
he signed in later than half an hour after classes!

&nbsp;

�I mean��the
girl�s voice persisted, �You�re an adult, Stu. You
should be able to hang out a little, in the afternoons, at night.� Dawn told me about your uncles, but strict as
they may be�� Stuart was glad the girl couldn�t see
him blush in humiliation. ��you�re a straight A student. I know Dawn was
exaggerating about you having an eight-thirty bedtime�right?
Couldn�t your uncles cut you a little slack, since you�re like�in your
twenties?�

&nbsp;

As the young man
penciled �4:54 pm� on the chart near the door, he sighed,stalling for time.

&nbsp;

Stu thought of Uncle John�s maxims on
slovenliness�Stu writing 5,000 times �I will not be
idle to shame my family� Oh, that clipboard, and all the paper!� Five thousand times, one letter in pencil,
one in ink�which meant switching from pencil to pen TWENTY-NINE times per
sentence�while standing on two iron chairs with the cinderblock hanging from
his testicles. But he�d learned. They did it because they loved him.

&nbsp;

�Yes, yes,� Stu tried to laugh. �I�m an adult in grad school, but my
uncles are a bit weird.� Stu looked up in horror as
he entered the kitchen, and there was Uncle John, glowering at him.

&nbsp;

Fortunately,
Uncle Pietro was still at work, as librarian at the State School for the Deaf. He started late, and had
already had time that morning to mousetrap Stu�s
nipples for half an hour as punishment for leaving scum on the inside of the
toilet during the a.m. bathroom chores. (Piet was the
permissive one. Uncle John would have mousetrapped
the nipples and tied Stu�s head into the toilet bowl
for an hour before letting him go to class.)

&nbsp;

But now he had to
do some damage control. Hurriedly. Stu
said �I�ve got to go, Brandi. I�ll talk to you soon.� He clicked off.

&nbsp;

��I made it clear, young fellow, that the cell
phone was for us to check up on you, not for you to conduct idle chatter to slatterns�
came the Marine�s voice. Uncle John had done three
tours�two in Korea and one in Vietnam. �Your Uncle Piet
wrote me a note that the Verizon bill has been quite
high�what are you using those minutes for?� Piet,
deaf since birth, had never quite taught John the sign language that he had
used quite easily with his nephews. �And why do you use your classmate�s first
name? In my day, we called our co-ed classmates MISS. Are you becoming sinfully
familiar with her?� Uncle John�s glass eye sparkled as he grilled his nephew.

&nbsp;

�Sir, I don�t use
the cell phone often.� I was just
checking up about my studies�we�re in a study group, Miss Dawson and myself.�
Would he believe that? Stu hurriedly dropped the cell
phone in his pocket. Putting his books down on the counter, the young M.B.A.
candidate ran his shaking fingers through his tousled blond hair, and smiled at
his uncle.

&nbsp;

Uncle John
scowled. �This cell phone thing is just an example of your disobedience, your wilfullness, just like your sinful older brother.� Oh, no,
thought Stu. He�s going to lecture me about Eli
again.

&nbsp;

�This is the trouble that your brother Elihu
had�� Uncle John said stolidly. �He couldn�t follow instructions. Willful, that
boy was. Ran away, he did, and the authorities would do nothing� And now he�s
living a sinful life, there�s no doubt about it. Because he
couldn�t live under our loving rules. And you�re willful just as he is.�
Well no, Stuart wanted to say. In 2001, the year Eli � ran
away� it could have been understandable. �Come with me, Stu,
you�re seventeen, I�m nineteen.� 

&nbsp;

Eli had begged as
Stu had assisted him in packing his bag. �Ten years
of hell, man. Hell, that�s right, I�ll say it. Eight o�clock bedtimes, not allowed out of the yard
outside school and church�and we�re adults! Being whipped with coat hangers and
razor wire�� Eli had shaken his head. �And what they do to us at night�that�s real wrong, man. Put in
diapers, being corn-holed, having to use our mouths for you-know what�let�s get
going!� But Stu had begged off because he was still a
minor, and he�d watched his brother jump out of the window and scurry off in
the night, with only six dollars to his name. Eli had never been the scholar
that Stu was, and had gone to work after high school,
and of course he�d turned every paycheck over to the uncles�but he�d saved his
carfare for a week, and then he�d gone�off to join the Air Force.

&nbsp;

Stu decided to change the subject. �So you�re
home, Uncle John�I thought you�d be grocery shopping or something, sir.� Uncle
John put down his copy of the New Testament and stared straight into his
nephew�s eyes. �Why? Do you want me to be out at this time?� Stu looked shocked. �No, Sir I��

�Is this your
time when you like to have the house to yourself, Boy?� Uncle John gritted his
teeth. Stu paled. Uncle John, a squat, muscled man an
inch or so shorter than his elegant nephew, was bristling under his stiff gray
handlebar moustache. �Do you spend your time alone in the house�not doing
chores, or� studying,
or reading Scripture but..touching
yourself�HERE?� Stu�s uncle grabbed his own crotch
and then snapped his fingers in Stu�s face. �For the
few hours that I�m away, is that what you do?� Uncle John�s voice rose.

&nbsp;

God, Uncle John
has a big dick�Stu thought about it. He could see the
bulge in John�s pants. Though Stuart had fellated Uncle John just that morning,
as the older man was showering, he was still surprised by Uncle John�s
tumescence. 

&nbsp;

Uncle John
stalked up to Stu and took the younger man by the
ear. �U-uncle John, I�m twenty-two years old.� Stuart tried to be firm. But he
had to travel as Uncle John was pulling Stu�s ear
down the hall.

&nbsp;

As Stu walked sideways, he felt his cock hardening swiftly against� the
ridiculous courdoroy trousers that his sensible uncle
made him wear. �Y-you shouldn�t be taking me by the ear like this, man!� As Stu and his uncle entered Stu�s
bedroom�there was no door on the room, as the uncles felt the boy would only
misuse privacy�Stu�s uncle let go of Stu�s ear and backhanded him harshly, so he almost fell to
the floor.

&nbsp;

As John�s hammy
fist moved away, a dribble of blood seeped from the boy�s mouth. �What did you
say?� Stu said more politely. �Why SIR are you taking
me by the ear SIR, please?� Uncle John grunted, not bothering to answer the
question. As Stu leaned against the wall, his uncle
walked over to Stu�s neatly made bed�it had to be
done at six a.m. with hospital corners, or Uncle Pietro,
Stu�s other uncle would bounce a quarter, and then
tear the sheets off�and THEN Stu�s ass was grass�

&nbsp;

Uncle John viciously
pulled the coverlet off the bed and pointed at the neatly ironed sheets.
�W-what�s wrong?� Uncle John stepped over to Stuart and slapped his face again.
Dizzily, Stu repeated the question. �SIR, what�s
wrong with the bed SIR.� He hadn�t been backhanded this much since Saturday,
when Piet had heard Stu use
the Lord�s name in vain. Between slapping him, Piet�s
hands had made various signs, telling Stu in American
Sign Language what a sinful boy he was�and then of course, Piet
had turned his thumb towards his crotch, and Stu had
dropped to his knees in service�what a Saturday that had been!

&nbsp;

Uncle John
screamed in Stu�s face. �I know what�s been going on
in this bedroom, Boy!�

&nbsp;

How could he
tolerate this? But he�d had a chance to escape this life, just last June.

�

&nbsp;

The year before, Stu had
graduated from Tufts University
with honors. That, of course was expected, as both his uncles had given him
vicious whippings, canings and tortures for getting less than an A minus on any
test, quiz or paper. But neither of his uncles had come to the ceremony, and Stu had not made friends with many of his classmates, not
ever having been allowed a social life. But as he�d walked off, discarding his
mortarboard, a tall man in an Air Force uniform had approached him. Eli!

&nbsp;

�Stu!
Magna cum laude, eh? So good to see you�you didn�t
answer my letters!� The brothers hugged. �Well, I knew you sent them.� Stu admitted. �Every time I got one it was intercepted by
Uncle Piet, who would then make the sign for
�Satan��� Eli laughed �I remember that sign of his!� 

&nbsp;

Stu continued �Yes, and then he�d tear the
letter up in front of me, and tie me to a chair, naked and give me the Poker
treatment.� Eli had looked very sober. Both brothers remembered the Poker
treatment, where Uncle Piet would bind the erring
nephew to a chair, naked and burn his foreskin with a white hot fireplace
poker.

&nbsp;

Eli had never
suffered from this as much as Stuart, because he
didn�t get erect when his uncles stripped him�it was pure torture. But Stu had�
that bent. �I�m so sorry, Stu.� Eli had
said. �But I wanted to tell you. I have a place to live, and I�m married
now�would you like to leave with me and go down to Florida, get away from those sadistic old men?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know�� Stu had said, and his brother had gone on �We could leave
right now�Gail is dying to meet you, she�s pregnant with twins! You 

could have a real life, you know? Girls,
dating, keeping the money you make�staying up all night, getting laid. And I
know the rules over there haven�t changed, I parked last night and saw the
lights go out at the house, and heard you screaming as Piet
thrashed you. Let�s get the hell out of here!�

&nbsp;

But Stu had firmly said no�he had to take care of his uncles.
But it hadn�t been that altruistic�the idea of living the �free life� just
didn�t �DO it for him. And he�d bade his puzzled
brother goodbye forever, and gone home to receive a whipping for being late
signing in! 

&nbsp;

�Are you
listening to me about these sheets?�

&nbsp;

Uncle John�s
voice brought Stuart back to the bedroom, and the
issues today. �What�s wrong, you little slimeball?�
John�s bushy eyebrows met. �The sheets are completely clean!�

&nbsp;

�What�s wrong
with my sheets being clean, Sir?� asked Stu feebly.
�Isn�t cleanliness next to Go�� But Uncle John slapped
him before continuing his tirade.

&nbsp;

�There is no
semen on these sheets! Unstained! They�ve been that way for eight DAYS.� Uncle
John bared his teeth. �One day, two days unstained, perhaps�but EIGHT?�

&nbsp;

Stu was puzzled, and he shrugged. �Why, SIR
is that wrong, Sir?� Uncle John smiled grimly. �You have had no nocturnal
emissions, no wet dreams in eight days, boy.� Stu
blushed hotly. Uncle John began removing his large leather belt.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�If you had not
been masturbating, you�d be having your sinful dreams�and there would be little
messes.� John scowled as the belt left his pants, loop by loop. Oh God�not
this, thought Stuart. I�ve been so careful. I burned my magazines so they
wouldn�t find them�but on THIS evidence he�s going to whip me? Having been
pre-law at Tufts University, Stu felt that
the evidence was certainly circumstantial.

�Sir�sir, really,
I took your last punishment to heart..� Stu was sweating as Uncle John pulled the belt off the last
loop and curled it into his hand. �B-but I�m older now�I don�t have wet dreams
anymore.� Would this work? Uncle John was not a stupid man.

&nbsp;

Uncle John
pointed to Stu�s waistband, and, tears welling in the
boy�s eyes, the boy shook his head. �You have no evidence��
Uncle John slapped the belt against his thigh, and Stuart�s cock swelled.
�You are a very potent young man, Stuart�usually you soil your sheets after one
of those disgusting dreams at least twice a week..or once. But not in eight days this time� John
grimaced, and pointed to Stu�s waistband once more,
and Stuart unbuttoned the top button his courdoroys,
and began unzipping his pants.

&nbsp;

This could be
worse, Stu thought, trembling as his pants were
lowered. Remember the time John and Piet burst into
the locker room and thrashed me in front of the basketball team? I was the
captain, and to be beaten like that in front of the boys�the laughingstock.

&nbsp;

Mechanically, Stu�s long white thighs in the little pink panties that Piet made him wear, were stepping out of the trousers, the
penny loafers already kicked under the bed.

&nbsp;

Once Stuart was naked, Uncle John viewed him disgustedly.
�Look at that sinful thing� he said, pointing to Stu�s
rock hard cock. Stu�s uncle swung the belt, slamming
it hard against Stu�s erection, and Stu screamed. 

&nbsp;

Uncle John then
took the�� belt in the middle and flogged
Stu�s erection with the heavy steel belt buckle until
Stu was completely limp, and the boy was sobbing. �Now then! Jerk your penis! Show me how you do it, you
disgusting, blasphemous creature!� Uncle John�s voice was savage.

&nbsp;

Stu looked at his uncle with puzzled, bleary
eyes. �Y-you want me to masturbate, Sir?� �NOW! You�re
so good at it!� Stuart began pulling his cock, and soon it became hard
again.� �Now, sir!
Hands behind your back!� Uncle John screamed at the
boy, and quickly Stuart obeyed. WHACK WHACK WHACK! The belt buckle sang against Stu�s
tortured glans as Uncle John swung it again and
again.

&nbsp;

Stu sobbed, and fell to his knees as the belt
lashed his cock. Finally it was limp yet again, and there was a tiny stream of
blood coming from the foreskin. �Masturbate again, Stuart!� Uncle John ordered.
�Now!� Stu looked pleadingly
at his Uncle John. �P-please Sir�no more!� Uncle John
threw the belt on the bed and picked up a long pointer that Stu
had been using at school as a Teaching Assistant to freshman Applied Economics
majors.

&nbsp;

�Masturbate
immediately, Stuart!� Stu�s cock was already
hardening, looking at Uncle John in his black jeans. Stuart began toying with
his cock, and then pumping it harder and harder�he was
getting closer to cumming. �Hands
behind your back!� Stu bit his lip and put his
hands behind his back. Uncle John lifted the harsh wooden pointer.

&nbsp;

SNAP! SNAP! SNAP!
The pointer rose and fell again and again against Stuart�s cock until it was
flagging, and then Uncle John hit once too hard and the pointer broke. Uncle
John didn�t even miss a beat, but just took up his belt again and continued
operations with the buckle end as Stuart screamed and danced�Finally he fell
the floor, and Uncle John kicked him in the stomach.

��Now� Uncle John said grimly. �It�s time for
your thrashing. You are going to get it across your buttocks as you deserve it.
Over the bed!�

As Stuart
tearfully threw his half-naked body across the bed at Uncle John�s grim,
pointing finger, he knew that his uncle loved him, and as� the belt buckle swung against Stu�s shaved balls for the first time, he worried he might
soil the sheet again in painful ecstasy.
