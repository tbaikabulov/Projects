FROM CHILD�S PLAY TO���.?

By

Bondoy

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I lay panting on the bed wondering, as usual when I was in this or a
similar situation, who the hell in their right mind would allow themselves to
get as frustrated as I was in my current position!� That position was being tied in a very strict
hog-tie and trying to get enough air after my efforts to escape even though,
from many previous experiences, I knew it was futile to try.

&nbsp;

My rope bonds had been very professionally applied.� Ankles firmly roped and cinched; wrists
similarly bound and then the two pulled tightly together with the knots
carefully placed well out of reach of my searching fingers.� More ropes were expertly tied around my knees
and my elbows were pulled as close together as was possible for a rather
inflexible middle aged man.� All this
just added to the severity of the hog-tie.

&nbsp;

Under all the ropes was a shiny black latex cat-suit and inside that I
was sweating freely from the exertions of trying to escape.� To add to my discomfort Beth had gagged me by
packing my mouth with a pair of her silky panties. She had carefully used her
thumbs to pack the material in until my cheeks were bulging.��� Showing some pity she had held a small
piece of cloth at the back of my head before she applied three inch wide shiny
black adhesive tape in several tight bands around my head to hold in the silken
salty tasting gag.� Getting the tape off
of my hair would pose a real problem. On top of all this� I was wearing a black leather head harness
strapped so tightly so that it was impossible for me to spit out the panties or
remove the gag in any way.

&nbsp;

To complete my discomfort Beth had forced on a very tight thick black
latex hood. This fitted like a second skin over my face and head after the rear
zipper was fastened and the laces tightened.�
Beth was a very thorough and detailed lady!!! 

&nbsp;

The eye openings in the hood were closed but there were two small ones
under my nose that allowed me to breathe through my nostrils.

&nbsp;

As I lay there completely helpless and totally dependent upon Beth, I
remembered that it had not always been like this.� My thoughts went back to when I first met her
some twelve years ago.� 

&nbsp;

I was then thirty years old and just over a rather acrimonious
divorce.� She was twenty seven and had
lost her husband two years previously when he died from a sudden heart attack
at the extremely early age of 28.

&nbsp;

Beth and I went out together for a few weeks, enjoying each other�s
company, while we both insisted that our relationship was not serious and
neither was expecting any commitment from the other.� Of course it didn�t stay that way and soon we
realised that we loved each other and both wanted to make a deeper relationship
work.

&nbsp;

Once I realised my feelings for her I decided to tell Beth of my interest
in bondage so there would be no secrets between us.

&nbsp;

One evening I sat her down with a bottle of wine between us and started
my story.

&nbsp;

When I was a very young child my father was an engineer responsible for
building factories that made specialised equipment. This meant he made regular
long trips abroad. My mother was a nurse and worked very long hours every
day.� I had a sister who was four years
older than me and an cousin named Dawn, who was the daughter of my aunt, looked
us after.

&nbsp;

I can remember as a child being looked after most of the time by Dawn.
When I was very young she and my sister Karen used to treat me as a toy and
dress me in dresses and other girls clothes. At that age I knew no different
and to me it felt quite normal. I suppose I must have enjoyed the attention
heaped upon me by the girls because I continued to let them fuss and dress me
even when I was old enough to know better.

&nbsp;

We lived in a largish village in the countryside. All of the children
used to play together in those days regardless of age or sex. Some of the games
were cowboys and Indians, cops and robbers and the like. These games required
two teams; one went out and tried to hide from the others. When anyone was
caught they were usually tied up in some way whether they were boys or girls.
At first I just tagged along and didn�t take part as I was too young. I
gradually got to understand the games and �helped� whichever team either my
sister or Dawn was in.

&nbsp;

As I got a bit older I clearly remember one day them telling me that I
was a robber and sending me out with the other kids on the team to hide.� A boy named Peter caught me easily and he
tied my hands behind my back and then to a fence-post before going off to catch
more thieves. Strangely enough I wasn�t scared and just felt really involved in
the game.� As the months passed we played
many times and I was always included even though I was much younger than the
others.

&nbsp;

I don�t know whether it was by chance or design but I was always a �
baddy� and always got caught and was duly fastened up. Sometimes it would be a
girl that caught me and I remember that it felt �different� when they tied up
me up.� I have to be honest and admit
that at the time I didn�t know why.

&nbsp;

This went on quite innocently for some months and during this time Dawn
was old enough to get a job. So I was left in the care of my sister Karen.� I guess I would have been about eleven by
this time and had started to become aware that girls were different than boys.
Still, I was very na�ve for my age.

&nbsp;

Karen had a best friend called Jill who was not a very attractive
girl.� Some people unkindly used to say
that my sister was only friends with her because Jill made my sister look even
more beautiful than she was. Jill was much bigger than Karen even though they
were about the same age.

&nbsp;

The games still went on and I was still nearly always on the side being
chased. By this time I was enjoying the results so much that I tried to
engineer what happened. As there were always more kids wanting to chase than be
chased, it wasn�t difficult for me to do this.�
My sister, however, used to hate being caught and tied and would do
anything to avoid it happening.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

One day, when I was about thirteen, we were all going out to play when it
started to rain so the game was called off and every one went their separate
ways except my sister, Jill and me.� We
stayed at our house and played board games and other things for a while. Then
Jill suggested we played tying up in the house.�� Karen was a little unsure while I wanted to
play but tried not to let it be too obvious.

&nbsp;

Finally, since� Karen didn�t like
being tied up and Jill was bigger than both of us, they decided that the two of
them would tie me up. We had a large cellar at our house that would be the best
place to do it. There was some old furniture stored down there and the two
girls found a very sturdy old wooden chair.

&nbsp;

I was told to sit down and they found several pieces of rope they used to
tie me tightly to the chair. I didn�t try to struggle or stop them and they
took their time tying me thoroughly with my wrists fastened to the back of the
chair and my ankles to the front legs. More rope held my elbows and knees to
the heavy chair.

&nbsp;

When they had finished they inspected my bonds and laughed. At this stage
I was unsure what would happen next perhaps expecting them to leave my tied for
a few minutes while they teased me then let me go. But after a few minutes of
giggling they went up into the house leaving me in the darkness on my own.

&nbsp;

It was a strange feeling. I was scared - but then again, I wasn�t.� In fact I was quite enjoying the feeling of
helplessness but I was scared that they would go out and leave me until my
mother� came home and found me. Those two
feelings remain with me even to this day.

&nbsp;

Of course I tried to escape and thrashing around and trying to reach the
knots but they had fastened me too well.��
I guess they left me like that for about an hour before coming back down
stairs laughing.� Strangely, I was both
relieved and upset at the same time when they released me.

&nbsp;

That episode led to many others.�
One night, when Karen and I were on our own, she asked me if I would
like to be tied up.� This was surprising
because it had always been Jill that had suggested those games before, but I
immediately agreed.� We went down to the
cellar and she told me she was going too put me in a hog-tie.� The two of them had tied me like that before
so I knew what to expect.� Somehow Karen
seemed much more intense that night and tied me really tightly; by now both she
and Jill knew how to tie ropes properly. 

&nbsp;

Karen tied my ankles and then cinched my wrists together behind my
back.� My knees were fastened and lastly
my elbows were pulled tightly together. Another rope was threaded through my
ankles and up to my wrists and pulled extremely tight; so much that my wrists
were almost touching my ankles.

&nbsp;

My sister brought out a large white handkerchief and stuffed it firmly in
my mouth. Then she brought out a roll of wide medical tape that must have been
brought in by my mother. She wound this tightly across my mouth.�� I had never been gagged properly
before.� sometimes I had been loosely
gagged when playing games but that was usually with a scarf.� This was completely different. 

&nbsp;

I was helpless and knew already that I wouldn�t be able to escape.� Then Jill came in and, strangely enough, this
time� I was embarrassed. I don�t know why
because she had been responsible for tying me up so many times before.� When she saw me, Jill laughed as usual then
she told Karen to go as she would look after me now.� Karen stared at me for a long moment then
waved goodbye and left me alone with Jill.�
I was much older before I figured out that my sister and her friend had
set me up.

&nbsp;

Jill told me Karen was going out to meet a boyfriend and that she would
look after me. During my useless efforts to escape I had rolled on to my side
and Jill bent down and easily heaved me back on my stomach.

&nbsp;

As she turned me over I was immediately became aware that I had an
erection and as she rolled me on to it� I
winced and mumbled into my gag.� Just
like any boy of my age I had previously experienced erections but never in
front of anyone, and certainly not a girl.�
Jill saw me shudder and rolled me back on my side.� Seeing the bulge in my pants she laughed and
I blushed with embarrassment.

&nbsp;

As I said earlier Jill was not a very pretty girl. She was however very
big for her age and quite well developed. She stroked the outside of my pants
over the bulge; I tried to pull away but was unable to.� She knew that I was embarrassed and that I
was sexually na�ve. She laughed even more and started to take off her blouse. I
could do nothing but watch her she was wearing a white bra that appeared to me
to be straining to contain her breasts. They were much bigger than my sisters.
I� once caught a quick glimpse of Karen
in the altogether as I burst into the bathroom on her. Jill unzipped the side
of her navy blue skirt and let it fall almost on my face. She was wearing thin
white panties that seemed tight on her. 

&nbsp;

Just then my sister came into the cellar having been stood up by her
boyfriend. I was full of mixed emotions.��
Jill just laughed when Karen asked her what she was doing.� She just said that she was just teasing me
and wasn�t going to do anything.� Then
pointed at the now even larger bulge in my trousers.� 

&nbsp;

My sister looked at me for a few moments and then burst out laughing
herself.� Jill, still in bra and panties
bent over and slid down the zip on my pants. Out popped my erect penis and they
both doubled up laughing.

&nbsp;

Jill looked at Karen, �Should I?�.��


&nbsp;

�What? � said Karen

&nbsp;

�You know.� said Jill.

&nbsp;

� You mean �.� said Karen.

&nbsp;

�Yes� laughed Jill. �He has to learn sometime. Why not now?�

&nbsp;

Karen looked undecided. �Well I�m not doing it.�

&nbsp;

Jill chuckled and said. �OK then I will.�

&nbsp;

She knelt beside me and, as I tried helplessly to pull away, she grabbed
hold of my penis and started to stroke it gently.� I was surprised that it was so pleasant but
then I saw Karen�s face and it made me embarrassed again.

&nbsp;

Jill just kept stroking me, increasing the speed until, all of a sudden,
something happened to me and I spurted out into Jill�s hand. 

&nbsp;

�You dirty little bugger�.� 

&nbsp;

She wiped the mess on my trousers.

&nbsp;

�That didn�t take long did it?� She said to Karen.

&nbsp;

�I think that was his first time and they do come quick at first.� She
said.� �Besides he has been tied up and
had you strip off in front of him is it any wonder he is excited?�

&nbsp;

Jill got dressed and she and Karen went out still killing themselves with
laughter.

&nbsp;

That was my introduction to masturbation and ejaculation.�� Being a nurse, my mother had given me the
obligatory session about the birds and the bees but there was no way she had
prepared me for the feelings involved.

&nbsp;

I know now that it was on that evening bondage and sexual satisfaction
became an irrevocable part of my makeup.��


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

While I was at university I lived in London and at first I
was very home-sick and lonely.� I found
that the bookshops in London had all kinds of
sex books and magazines if you knew where to look. I used to read these and
they made me want to try the �real thing�.

&nbsp;

So on a couple of occasions I did pay for �mistresses� to tie me up and
punish me.� I found these experiences
totally unpleasant. Maybe it was a combination of me not being very experienced
and not able to describe exactly what I wanted plus the fact I had little money
and could not pay for anyone very experienced or well recommended.

&nbsp;

Then I met my first wife and was so besotted with her that all thoughts
of bondage and any other deviant activities just disappeared from my head.
However, after we had been going together for a few months, the topic of
bondage came up and my girlfriend (as she was then) readily agreed to try it.
So we began by me tying her up.� After a
few rather disappointing bondage sessions we stopped but our sexual activities
carried on as previously. Then one night she asked me if I would allow her to
tie me up to see if that could be more satisfying.� Of course I agreed and it became an instant
success; Joan, it seemed, was a born Domme.

&nbsp;

So bondage was on the agenda regularly but always with me as the
submissive and, of course, I didn�t resist. Joan liked to punish me and
sometimes she seemed to get carried away giving me some quite painful sessions.
This was surprising because she was not in any way a cruel or hurtful person. I
didn�t really ever take to the actual pain but this was usually only a small
part of any session. I always enjoyed the total experience and felt extremely
happy with her.

&nbsp;

After some months we decided to marry and that was when our problems
started. For some reason, that I still don�t understand even today, sexually
she became distant and uninterested.�
Normal sex, let alone bondage, was not often on her menu. I tried to
talk it out with her but never really got to find what was wrong.� After our talks she would try, but I knew
that she wasn�t happy.

Soon things began to get worse for both of us and it was inevitable that
we would part; we divorced after five years.

&nbsp;

After the divorce I didn�t go out with any women for quite some
time.� I needed some time and space to
have to myself and find out what I wanted to do.

&nbsp;

I used to fantasise about bondage while surfing the Internet; looking at
pictures, video clips and reading bondage stories to get some satisfaction.

&nbsp;

Then I met Beth. We went out together several times and we both realised
that we were getting serious. After my experiences with my first wife I decided
that I had to lay my cards on the table with her straight away. When I finished
baring my soul I think she was more than a little surprised, if not shocked.
But then she took a sip of wine and said that she loved me and was game to try
and understand where I was coming from.

&nbsp;

We chatted about it and I tried to explain how I felt and what voluntary
bondage was all about. I showed her some of the magazines, books and videos
that I had collected and after some time she agreed to let me tie her up.� 

&nbsp;

At that stage she had only seen pictures of women being tied and
naturally thought that is what I wanted to do. I didn�t tell her of my interest
in being tied as I thought it might be just too much this early in our
relationship.

&nbsp;

So we started with in bondage sessions where Beth was usually tied
spread-eagled to the four corners of our bed.�
We bought leather cuffs and lined them with foam rubber so that they
were comfortable to wear and didn�t leave any lasting marks. 

&nbsp;

We both thoroughly enjoyed this and it became a regular feature of our
foreplay when we made love, which was often.�
We were very happy and our sex life was fantastic.� We experimented and Beth allowed me to tie
her in different positions then we began to enjoy role play.

&nbsp;

Some time after this one night Beth shocked me when out of the blue she
asked me if I would like her to tie me up. �Not wanting to appear too keen about it, I
pretended to be reluctant at first but eventually I agreed.

&nbsp;

The first time she fastened me to the bed in the same manner I did to
her, using the same cuffs.� We both
enjoyed this immensely. After a short while we were taking turns tying each
other.� We were very happy about our
lives together and went on like this for a few months.

&nbsp;

It was at this stage that we decided to marry. But unlike the first time,
marriage seemed to bring us both even closer together and we just could not get
enough of each other.� This is still the
case today after many years I am delighted to say.

&nbsp;

We experimented with cuffs and straps fastening each other in different
positions enjoyed this immensely; our sessions grew more regular and each
session grew longer.� It got so we could
each remain in bondage for a number of hours without any problems.� After some sessions we would have a few
drinks and discuss the enjoyment and describe our feelings. The drinks made us
even more open with each other and we discussed other scenes and positions that
we would like to try.

&nbsp;

Then one night I told Beth that I would like her to tie me with rope
explaining my fantasy of being tied really tight then gagged and left so that I
could try to escape. 

&nbsp;

At first it was not very successful.�
Beth had never used ropes before and I had no problems in escaping with
some ease. I used to deliberately not try to escape because I didn�t want to
discourage her. �She soon realised this
and it made her more determined to learn how to do things properly.

&nbsp;

With some advice from me plus the use of pictures, magazines and videos
she soon became quite proficient and quickly mastered the techniques of knots
and bondage positions.� Naturally, we had
a lot of practice!!! 

&nbsp;

For a couple of months I seemed to be tied up more than I was free and my
wife became almost obsessed at mastering the art. ( I am pleased to say)

&nbsp;

She even went as far as talking to mistresses and dominatrixes on the
Internet and became very friendly with one experienced lady.�� They used to talk to each other frequently;
she was in Oxford, which was less than half an hour�s
drive from where we lived. 

&nbsp;

Beth would go to her house for coffee and drinks once a week and through
her she learned a lot.�� They are still
very friendly and she still chats with her and asks for advice on occasions
about equipment, techniques, safety and other related topics.

&nbsp;

Over the past ten years or so we have built up quite a stock of bondage
equipment that includes literally miles of rope, hundreds of leather straps of
all shapes and sizes, lengths of chain, various types of handcuffs and
leg-irons, whips and canes and several padlocks.

&nbsp;

There are a couple of strait jackets, many different hoods, masks and
gags and a good selection of latex suits and jackets. I even have a �wardrobe�
of female clothes because Beth likes to dress me as a woman in some of our
scenes.

&nbsp;

My wife also has a special wardrobe with has lots of leather and latex
clothing, corsets, high-heel boots and some uniforms. She loves PVC and SBR
raincoats and occasionally I will fasten her up outside in the rain back in an
obscure part of our garden.

&nbsp;

We converted our cellar into a dungeon and we have a number of pieces of
bondage furniture.� There�s bondage
apparatus such as a Saint Andrew�s Cross and a couple of electric hoists that
we use to stretch or even suspend one another.�
There are lots of fixing points around the walls and on the floor.� We have a combined pillory and stocks
arrangement that gets used regularly along with a metal bed that bolts to the
floor, a bondage table and a very strong, specially constructed, bondage chair.
I mention this because it features in the strange story I am about to tell you.

&nbsp;

Happily, we have come a long way in the past few years.� 

&nbsp;

In ten years of marriage our bondage has evolved from those early days.

&nbsp;

Although occasionally I still tie Beth up the vast majority of time she
tops me because, immediately after that first time, it became obvious that she
got a great buzz out of rendering me helpless.

She loves to be in control and I enjoy it too.

&nbsp;

So, that gets us back to where I started this story��������

&nbsp;

I was in our bedroom in one of the simplest yet most effective bondage
positions there is.� Despite all the
equipment and knowledge that Beth has gained she still likes to use the
hog-tie.� I suppose because it is both
quick and easy to do. Her rope-work is now quite expert and the ropes applied
firmly but not tight enough to affect the circulation.

&nbsp;

The wrists get several loops of a quarter inch soft rope and they are
cinched. Then she pulls the elbows together and over the years I have been able
to get them quite close together.� Then
my ankles were tied together and then the legs, both above and below the knee.� With another rope my wrists and ankles were
drawn together as I said, simple, but very effective. 

&nbsp;

How long I had been lying there I really don�t know because despite all
the number of occasions I had been tied, I still lose all track of time when my
senses are isolated. I was stiff and uncomfortable but not in any pain. The
previous months of practice being tied for increasingly long periods helped
enormously.

&nbsp;

I heard the door to the bedroom open but the thick carpet muffled any
other sounds.� It remained very quiet and
for a moment I thought that she had not come in the room.� Then I felt a sharp stinging sensation on the
side of my right buttock, followed swiftly by one on the left.

&nbsp;

I heard her �Domme� voice snarl. � You are supposed to be trying to
escape, not just lying there resting.� 

&nbsp;

I started wrestling frantically again but, even though I struggled as
hard as I could, there was no way to free myself. 

&nbsp;

Beth really got turned on seeing me helpless and unable to escape from
her rope-work.� She teased and punished
me for some time until she decided to let me free.� We followed that bondage session with
exciting, even mind-blowing, sex. 

&nbsp;

She knows that while I am tied up I often fantasise about different
positions and situations for me to be restrained.� She asked me what I had thought about that
night and I told her that I imagined her tying me up outside in a quiet place
in the country.� She then left me while
she went off to visit with some friends.

&nbsp;

I thought no more about this but over breakfast the next day she told me
that she liked the idea of tying me up somewhere outside. We discussed how we
could do it but I heard no more and thought that she had either forgotten or
had decided against it.� Even though the
idea really turned me on I didn�t push it because I didn�t think that she
wanted to do it.� One possibility was
that she was unhappy about having to ignore the cardinal rule of safe
bondage.� You never, ever, leave someone
helpless and gagged alone.

&nbsp;

A couple of weeks passed and nothing more was said when, out of the blue
one week-end, she mentioned it again; my heart leapt partly with excitement and
partly with fear.

&nbsp;

Beth obviously sensed my feelings and asked if, since I wanted to do it
so much, why didn�t I search for a suitable place?� She would come and look at what I found and
then decide whether she thought it was reasonable to go ahead. At that stage I
really didn�t know what I wanted to do or whether I really could go through
with the scene even if she decided yes.

&nbsp;

So for a few days I deliberately did nothing about it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I don�t know whether it was fate or just co-incidence but something
happened shortly afterwards that moved things on.

&nbsp;

I make a very good living as a plumber and a couple of weeks later I
received an emergency call from a friend of mine who had just taken over
ownership of a country pub about twenty miles from where we live.� He needed my services ASAP.� I knew the village and had heard of the pub
but had never visited it before.� Luckily
the plumbing problem was fixed relatively easily but on the way home I took a
wrong turn and realised it only after travelling a couple of miles along a
little used road.

&nbsp;

Looking for a place to turn around I spotted an opening in an overgrown
hedge.� Turning into the gap led me to a
small piece of land that looked as if it had once been a cindered car park.

&nbsp;

There was a long, low, brick building that after a few seconds I realised
was an old railway station.� The large
windows of the building had long since been boarded up. I�d had a couple of
beers after finishing work at the pub and looked for a place where I could have
a pee.

&nbsp;

I got out and started to look around the outside of the building.� The large brown double doors were securely
locked and I could not see through the boarded up windows.� I walked along front following a hedge that
was growing alongside a wire fence.� A
few yards along there was a gap in the fence, no doubt made by children.� Once through the gap I came on to the railway
tracks.� I could see by the rusty rails
that no train had passed this way for many years.

&nbsp;

After relieving myself against the hedge I walked along to the platform
of the old station and found that it was not in a bad condition.� The most surprising feature was that the old
reinforced glass canopy over the platform was still completely intact.

&nbsp;

If there had been any houses close the station there certainly weren�t
any now. On the platform there were several doors on which I could see the
original titles of the employees.� The
one marked �Station Master� was locked from the outside with two large
padlocks.

&nbsp;

I went to the car for my tool-box then it was a simple task to unscrew
the brackets holding the hasps of the padlocks and go into the office.� It was pitch black but I had a torch and saw
a light switch on the wall.�� It didn�t
work but further along the wall in a corner was a large lever switch and once
that was up I tried the light switch again and it worked.

&nbsp;

On the wall of the office was a small glass fronted cabinet with a line
of hooks bearing an assortment of keys.� Among
the many bunches of keys there were ones for the waiting room, the booking
office and the front door.� Using the
last two got me from the office into the small booking hall. �From this two large brown double doors led back
out to the platform.

&nbsp;

All of a sudden it hit me that this might be a good place for our
isolation bondage session. I felt a tingle of trepidation.�� With my thoughts miles away I closed the
doors and went back to the station master�s office.� There I found the padlock keys so I
re-fastened the brackets back to the door.

&nbsp;

Pocketing the keys I walked back to my car with my heart beating rapidly
and realised I had a strong erection; clearly I was excited by the fantasy in
my mind.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I drove away from the station and after about half a mile, the country
lane snaked over a narrow bridge.� From
the car I couldn�t see the track that I knew was below so I parked and looked
along the way back to the station.

&nbsp;

�I could just see the rusty ribbon
of track leading my eye to the deserted old stopping point. Although I couldn�t
really tell in the gathering darkness, I thought that it would take a very keen
eye to see anything clearly on the platform.�
The idea in my mind became even clearer.

&nbsp;

I couldn�t wait to get home to talk to Beth and when I arrived told her
about my find.� To my surprise she was
very keen to see it but I was starting to get butterflies in my stomach. 

&nbsp;

The next evening we went and looked at the station again. Beth was quite
impressed and we inspected all the offices and out buildings.� Then we checked that the front doors would
open easily and she seemed to be satisfied.

&nbsp;

We locked up and went to the pub for a quick drink and to discuss the
idea about using the station. As we talked I knew that the idea was rapidly
forming into a plan. I was not sure now that things were turning out this way,
whether to be pleased or not. Either way I was starting to feel more than a
little apprehensive.

&nbsp;

When we arrived home we continued talking it over as we drank a bottle of
our favourite red wine. Beth appeared very keen to go ahead, but I thought this
was just an attempt to try and scare me off.�
Of course I wasn�t going to climb down, certainly not at this early
stage.�� But to allay some of my concerns
we agreed that I should make a few more visits to the site and check things
over.� For instance did anyone ever visit
the deserted station or did dog walkers use the track as short cuts? Those and
other concerns were buzzing in my head. 

&nbsp;

Over the next few weeks I made several visits to the station checking it
out at different times of the day and night.�
Eventually I had to tell Beth that there was no reason to not go ahead
with our plan.

&nbsp;

While planning the scene we had decided that to use the bondage chair
that I had made and installed in the cellar a couple of years earlier.

&nbsp;

We agreed that a Saturday evening would be best for the session.� It was summer and would not be dark until
about eleven. The plan was for me to be restrained and left on the platform
from 6.30 until about 11.00 in the evening. I tried to argue that inside the
Station Master�s office would be best but Beth was adamant that we had agreed
right at the start that it had to be outside in the open for it to satisfy my
fantasy.� I couldn�t argue, because Beth
was right, and I agreed to the platform.

&nbsp;

We talked about how we would get the chair and the other equipment
required into the station without being seen and I suggested taking the chair
and what-ever else we required the day before and set it up.

&nbsp;

I went to the station another couple of times, one of them at the actual
time on the Saturday that we would carry out our intended plan. There was nothing
to suggest that there would be any problems at all. So the days flashed by and
I grew ever more nervous as the day approached.

&nbsp;

On the Friday I went to the station taking the bondage chair and a very
large hold-all, leaving them locked in the Station Manager�s office.

The chair was one that I had designed and made myself some years
previously. I had used oak wood smoothed and varnished then designed to be
bolted to the floor so that no amount of struggling would upset the chair.

&nbsp;

For this occasion I had made a strong wooden base because I did not want
to drill holes in the concrete platform.�
The chair was constructed with a very high back and strong arms. All the
joints were secure.� We had used the
chair at home many times before because of the many fixing points built into
it. 

&nbsp;

The legs were designed with two sets of strong struts. One set halfway up
between each of the legs.� The other four
struts were at the bottom so that the chair was made stronger and at the same
time could be bolted to the floor.� I
brought in the heavy base that I had already drilled with holes to fasten the
chair.

&nbsp;

I went to the village pub for a quiet drink to reflect. My hands were
shaking slightly as I thought about what was going to take place the next
night.� Then I consoled myself that Beth
would not carry through with the idea.�
She would go right to the brink but would pull out at the end.� With this thought uppermost I smiled as I
drove home.�� 

&nbsp;

The next day we acted just like any Saturday, lying in bed late and then
reading the papers and having a breakfast.�
Beth showed no signs of what we were about to do; but then she never
did.

&nbsp;

Finally it was time to go to the station and we parked off to the side
near the hedge so as not to broadcast that anybody was around.� I was feeling tense and yet at the time
strangely almost remote from what was happening. 

&nbsp;

We went through the station and on to the platform from the booking
office. 

&nbsp;

By now Beth was acting very cockily and I knew that she was goading me.
We often played this silly mental game where each one was trying to impress the
other that he or she was not going to back down.� Of course, in this particular situation, it
was stupid of me to act in this way because I was the one who was going to have
to have the discomfort of being tied and the possible embarrassment or fear of
being discovered while in that compromising position.

&nbsp;

Beth had really nothing to lose and was hardly likely to back down. Her
attitude was that if I was stupid enough to want to do it, then she should not
have to be the one who backed off.� There
went the excuse I had visualised getting me out of the plan.

&nbsp;

So, with slightly trembling fingers, I opened up the padlocks to the
Station Master�s office and carried out the bondage chair and placed it in the
position that I had previously chosen on the platform.� I bolted the chair to the base then got out
the large holdall that contained all the necessary restraints and equipment
that Beth would need to complete her task.

&nbsp;

Although it was a warm muggy evening I was shivering slightly; Beth just
looked at me with that teasing grin on her face; then she told me to strip
completely.� I went into the office and
undressed to my underpants. I know it is crazy but I felt that I wanted to
maintain some form of pride.� Beth
laughed and told me sharply to get them off.

&nbsp;

She threw me a jar of lubricating gel and I rubbed it all over my naked
body. This was to ease on the already lubricated thick rubber cat suit I was
going to wear for the occasion.� As I
carefully pulled on the suit I finally accepted that I would go through with
the scene as it was obvious that Beth was not going to pull out.� The suit was very tight fitting thick shiny
black rubber; I had cleaned and shined it before carefully wrapping it up to
bring.� It had a high collar and closed
at the back with a very strong zipper from the waist to the back of the neck.
It also had �convenience� zips.� Two ran
across the chest at the height of the nipples, one at the crotch and another at
the rear allowing anal entry.

&nbsp;

Beth tossed me a pair of latex socks then passed me the knee length high
heeled ladies boots that she insisted that I should wear.

&nbsp;

� OK then.� Outside.� She snapped. 

&nbsp;

I walked unsteadily on the four inch heels and the chair seemed to stand
out as I tottered towards it.� It was as
if the high backed piece of specially designed bondage furniture was
threatening me. At the time it almost felt as though I was walking to the
electric chair.

&nbsp;

Beth made me sit right back with my spine up against the strong centre
spar of the chair back. When she was happy that I was in the correct position,
she threaded a six inch wide heavy black leather belt around my waist and the
chair back then through a large ring bolt positioned to prevent the belt from
moving up or down. This pinioned me firmly to the chair.

&nbsp;

There were several of these ring bolts strategically attached to the
chair.�� The seat was high and designed
deliberately so that my feet could not touch the floor.� Beth bent down and strapped my right ankle to
the right leg of the chair.� Another 3�
wide strap fixed just below the knee rendered my lower leg immobile.� She immobilised the upper leg by threading� another wide strap through the designed slots
in the seat of the chair.

&nbsp;

My left leg was treated in the same manner then Beth stood back and
observed her work. She smiled with approval. Her eyed danced mischievously as
she silently mocked me.

&nbsp;

�Now for the arms�.� She reached
for more straps.

&nbsp;

She took my right arm and placed it on the strong flat platform that was
the arm of the chair. First she pulled my upper arm against the upright outer
spar of the chair back and used two straps, one above the biceps and one
below.� She was nothing if not thorough.
Then she fixed my lower arm and wrist to the horizontal arm of the chair.� My right arm was now fixed� rigidly to the chair and I was beginning to
feel extremely helpless and vulnerable.

&nbsp;

At this stage I began to doubt whether I could go on, but the sight of
Beth�s taunting face made me more determined not to give her the satisfaction
that she would derive and ram down my throat if I pulled out.

&nbsp;

Soon my left arm was immobilised. 

&nbsp;

Beth stood back and studied me with that annoying look.� She checked each fastening individually
ensuring that they were firm but not too tight.

&nbsp;

I knew there was more to come!!

&nbsp;

She selected a longer and wider strap and fastened my upper chest to the
chair back. 

After she had buckled that belt tightly to the chair she stuck her face
just a couple of inches from mine.� �Last
chance saloon, if you want to pull out, do it now. I won�t give you another
chance.�� She pouted and laughed as she
said it.

&nbsp;

I didn�t say anything at all.

&nbsp;

�OK. Don�t say I didn�t give you the opportunity�. 

&nbsp;

She bent down and rummaged in the holdall then stood up with a shiny
black latex hood in her hand.� Carefully
pulling this in position she made sure that my nose was protruding through the
aperture in the centre. The hood fitted very tightly, it had eye holes and a
mouth aperture but was one I hadn�t seen before because there were inch square
mesh openings at each ear. My face felt as if was being squeezed in a huge
vice.

&nbsp;

More rummaging and she came out with another hood.� This one though again black shiny latex was a
much thicker gauge of material.� She had to
struggle but after a while she had it correctly placed over my head and face.
Instead of� a nose hole there was a
shaped nose with two small apertures.�
Beth made sure that these aligned with my nostrils. It also had both eye
holes and a mouth aperture and, again the latex mesh at each ear.

&nbsp;

My face felt even tighter as the two layers of rubber stretched and
contracted.

&nbsp;

To my consternation Beth went to the bag yet again and came up with a
head harness. This consisted of a set of leather straps, silver chromium
buckles and D rings that made a very efficient harness. Straps fitted over the
head, across the forehead, down the sides of the nose in an inverted V.� Worst of all was the black hard rubber gag,
slightly larger than a golf ball, which she pushed in my mouth and held it in
place with another of the harness straps.�


&nbsp;

My wife went around me slowly inspecting and adjusting each of the many
straps and buckles until she was happy that everything fitted to her
satisfaction.� Another trip to the goody
bag revealed a four inch wide leather collar that she fitted it neatly around
my neck pulling both the hoods and the harness even more firmly against my face
and neck.

&nbsp;

She pushed my head against the high chair back and padlocked the collar
to the back of the chair.� Then she
padlocked the back of harness strap which went around my forehead to the chair
back.� Now I could hardly move a muscle. 

&nbsp;

Reluctantly, I had to admit that Beth was nothing if not thorough and
somehow despite my predicament I both loved and admired her for what she had
done and the manner in which she had done it.

&nbsp;

She stood back victoriously and glanced down at the erection that was
bulging against the restrictive wall of the cat suit.� Beth smiled and knelt in front of me slowly
opening the zipper at my crotch.� As soon
as the fastening started to open my penis thrust itself out of confinement and
stood proudly erect.� Beth laughed as she
stroked it gently.� Then she slid open
the nipple zips. Finding my nipples, one between each forefinger and thumb she
played with them knowing that it would work me up to a lather. She took me to a
state of ecstasy and then stopped suddenly. 

&nbsp;

Kneeling in front of me again she carefully pushed my still engorged and
throbbing penis back inside the rubber and closed the zip. The nipple zips were
also closed one after the other. I was very disappointed but was helpless to do
anything about it.

&nbsp;

I knew that this was the moment I had been dreading as she bent and
whispered in my ear.� �I�ll be leaving in
a minute darling.� You have done a lot of
stupid things in your time but this one takes the biscuit.�� She laughed as she stood up.� She then looked me over once again like a
pilot of a plane making his final checks before take off.� 

&nbsp;

She put the rest of the equipment�
back in the holdall and went to the office behind me. Of course I
couldn�t move my head to see where she was. I heard her close the door and the
metallic clicks as she closed the padlocks.�
There was a swishing rustling sound as she walked back in front of
me� putting on her long SBR raincoat. 

&nbsp;

�Oh dear it�s starting to rain.� She said as she buttoned and belted the
coat; she looked so desirable.� Beth came
towards me and for a second I thought she was going to let me go. Instead she
pulled the zips across my eyes after adjusting the inner rubber flaps to ensure
that I could not even see a speck of light.

&nbsp;

�Bye darling. I decided that since you can�t speak or see it would be fun
to let you hear everything going on around you.�
Imagination is such a turn on, isn�t it?�
See you at eleven o�clock�.� I could smell the scent of her perfume and
wanted her even more. 

&nbsp;

I heard her heels clicking on the platform floor as she walked away then
the door being opened and locked from the other side.� I couldn�t�
hear anything else and thought perhaps she was standing still behind the
platform door.�� Maybe she had changed
her mind and was waiting before coming back to free me; somehow it all seemed
like a dream. 

&nbsp;

Then I heard the dull thud as the large outer door was pulled closed. My
heart fell; she had gone.

&nbsp;

At first I was devastated and couldn�t believe that she had left me like
this even though it was originally my idea. I started to try to struggle
against my bonds. It was useless because they had been too expertly fitted to
allow any movement let alone a chance of escape. Then I knew I was there until
Beth returned to free me.

&nbsp;

I stopped the useless struggles and gradually started to think more
clearly. I knew then that I couldn�t blame Beth for this.� It was my own fault and she had only done what
I asked her to do.

&nbsp;

I tried to move my head to see if I could manoeuvre it into a position
where I could see. I thought that maybe I could get the helmet to move slightly
allowing just a slit of daylight through.�
But it was no use. I couldn�t move my head even a millimetre; Beth had
seen to that!

&nbsp;

Then the magnitude of what I had done hit me. I had placed my complete
trust in Beth to come back and release me. It was a huge responsibility to
place upon anyone.� My mind started to
play tricks with me, I knew that I loved Beth and she loved me but I started to
doubt that in those early moments of my imprisonment.

&nbsp;

�What if she doesn�t love me and she did this but is not coming back to
let me go.� I thought.� For a few moments
I almost panicked and started to struggle again.

&nbsp;

It was of course futile and I subsided into utter desolation.

&nbsp;

But I found that I couldn�t stop the thoughts rushing through my mind. 

&nbsp;

� What if someone else finds me?�. I thought. �What will they do? Will
they call the police?�� These and all
kinds of other ideas raced through my head.

&nbsp;

Then I heard a noise and hoped it was Beth coming back early. 

&nbsp;

I heard the sound again and realised it was the rain drumming on the
platform�s glass roof. The sound got louder as the rain drove down. �Even through the rubber I felt a cool wind
blow and as it passed me and it made me shiver.�
I could hear water gurgling and dripping as it ran off the roof and
awnings of the old station.

&nbsp;

�At least this storm will keep people away.� I consoled myself.

&nbsp;

I don�t know how long the rain kept on because being tied like this and
unable to see I lost all track of time. The rain eased and later started again;
this happened several times as I tried to calculate how long I had been
there.� It felt like hours but I knew
from past experience that it would be nowhere near as long as it felt.�� After a long period I� got drowsy and I think I even dropped off a
few times.

&nbsp;

When I was awake the restriction of movement was becoming uncomfortable
even though previous practice sessions had accustomed me to being tied this way
for long periods.

&nbsp;

How long this went on I just do not know but I thought that it� must be getting late by now. Inside that
cocoon of latex and leather it felt like it had to be at least midnight. I can�t explain why I felt like this, it was just a
combination of me knowing that I had been tied for hours and a kind of sixth
sense telling me it was late evening. Of course this is what I wanted to think
because meant the time for my release was close.

&nbsp;

The wind blew a little stronger along the platform and it started to rain
heavily again. I listened fascinated by the many different sounds of water
splashing off the deserted building before losing all track of time again.� Again I seemed to fall into a dreamless
half-asleep state.

&nbsp;

Waking with a start I was becoming very concerned because surely it must
be eleven o�clock by now??

&nbsp;

I heard a slight sound but this time ignored it having been deceived so
many times already.� Then I heard another
sound and strained to listen but I couldn�t make it out. Then I clearly heard
what sounded like the click of heels on the platform to my right coming
closer.� I hadn�t heard a door open and the
sounds seemed to be coming from my left which was the wrong direction. 

&nbsp;

Maybe Beth had forgotten the keys and had to find a gap in the hedge. The
footsteps came closer� then stopped
behind me.� I wriggled and tried to speak
but only a muffled �mmmppphhh� came out.

&nbsp;

I heard the footsteps move round in front of me.� Again I wriggled futilely and �mmppphhhh�d �
harder.� I could almost feel the person
next to me. I had never been so pleased for Beth to come to me. I felt her
fingers softly brush across my face.� The
fingers ran around the thick leather collar and tickled under my chin.� I couldn�t do anything to respond so sat
helplessly while she enjoyed herself.�
She ran her fingers across my chest and the tight latex increased the
sensation rather than masking it.

&nbsp;

Slowly she pulled open the zip encasing my left nipple and tweaked it
firmly between thumb and forefinger.�
Then she opened the other nipple zip and playfully tweaked that now
hardened teat. She played with both nipples simultaneously and I started to
become aroused.� I felt her lips on my
chest as her mouth sought my nipple. Taking it between her teeth she gave me
that bitter sweet sensation of painful pleasure.

&nbsp;

Beth must have been worked up too because her bite was slightly harder
than usual. Then she turned to the other nipple and that received the same
wonderful treatment.� I heard the swish
of her raincoat as she adjusted her position and started to unzip my crotch. My
penis rose to meet her soft hands and she stroked me gently. Then she scratched
one of her nails slowly along the length of my erection. 

�

By this time I was almost at bursting point and was unable to control
myself. I was just a helpless victim to whatever she wanted to do to me.

&nbsp;

Again I heard the swishing sound as she bent and took my penis in her
soft mouth.� Her tongue was like a
lizard�s as it snaked in and out licking my throbbing member.� I was becoming completely ecstatic by this
time and I knew that if she continued I would soon explode. 

&nbsp;

She pulled her head away and again I heard the swishing sound as she� took my penis in her hand and started to
masturbate me.� It didn�t take long to
bring me to the brink but she stopped just before I exploded and she let me
cool down for what seemed like ages. Then I heard the beautiful mackintosh
music as she returned and started to stroke me again.� Several times she brought me to the brink
like this only to leave me hanging.

&nbsp;

Finally she didn�t stop and matched the frantic rhythm of my throbbing
penis with her insistent stroking.��
Inevitably I exploded and whether it was because the constrained and
restrained position heightened the experience, I felt as though I had shot gallons
of sperm like a jet from a fireman�s hose.

&nbsp;

After a few minutes I calmed down and felt my penis being pushed back
into the suit and the zip being closed again. Then the nipple zips were closed
and all became silent.� She must have
been standing still looking at me for the last time before releasing me.

&nbsp;

To my shock I heard the swishing and the clip-clop of her heels recede
off to my left.� At first I thought she
was just playing with me. But the steps kept going further away until I could
hear them no more.� Frantically I
strained to try to hear her but it was complete silence.� Then I thought that she must be having a joke
and had gone around to the front of the building to come in by the doors.� But I waited and nothing happened.

&nbsp;

I was now completely confused. �I
came to the conclusion that Beth had gone to the pub and would return
later.� She was making me pay for putting
her out like this with my stupid ideas. Time went on and it seemed light years
since she had gone.� I couldn�t think
what had happened. I knew now that it had to be really late; then it started to
rain again.

&nbsp;

More time passed. Again I wondered what could have happened?� Much as I thought and worried, nothing
happened.�� I was beside myself and I
don�t think I have ever been so frightened in my life.

I don�t know whether it was the strain of what had happened to me all day
but I dozed off once again and slept fitfully; but for how long I couldn�t
know.

&nbsp;

I woke up to a noise; surely it was a car!�� She has arrived at last and come into the
car park in spite of saying she wouldn�t.�
Yes!! I heard the door being opened and steps crossing the booking hall.
The door opened and the steps approached me.�
At last!� I was beside myself with
emotion. I couldn�t have explained at that moment how happy I felt to know that
Beth had finally arrived and was walking towards me to set me free.

&nbsp;

I tried to wriggle to let Beth know how excited I was but my constraints
prevented me from any movement.�� I felt
her fingers as they found the zips that were preventing me from being able to
see. As the zips were� opened, I blinked
and had to close my eyes for a few seconds as the light hit them. As my eyes
adjusted to the brightness I was astounded to see not my wife but a
police-woman looking at me with a wide smirk on her face!

&nbsp;

To say I was shocked is a total understatement!� I just could not believe my eyes when I saw
the uniform there in front of me. I just didn�t know what to think. As I gazed
unbelievingly at the constable I tried to think what could have happened and at
the same time realised it was daylight.

The police-woman just stood in front of me staring at what must have been
a very strange sight even for a woman in her profession.� She was very tall and slim and very
attractive.

&nbsp;

�That�s it.�� I thought �This is
part of the act. She is one of those kiss-o-gram models that Beth has hired to
get me really wound up.�� But as I looked
further at the woman, the uniform was authentic and even included a flak vest
under the bright rubber raincoat; this really was a police officer.

&nbsp;

She looked me quizzically up and down for a few more seconds and a smile
started to replace her smirk. She walked in a circle around me and then stood
once again in front where I could see her.�
She asked me I was all right and I blinked frantically since no other
movement was possible.

&nbsp;

Then she walked off along the platform and I lost sight of her.� I heard the platform door open and close. I
thought I heard the main front door clunk to. I was in a quandary what to
think. I couldn�t understand why she had left me. Maybe she had been a plant by
Beth after all?�� Then the doors opened
again and soon she stood in front of me.�
I could hear the metallic sound of a voice and noticed her radio on her
shoulder. 

&nbsp;

In her hands she carried a small camera. She came up to me and closed the
eye covers. �One for the photograph album��
I heard her murmur.

&nbsp;

After some moments the zips were pulled open again and I blinked again at
the light but not as badly as previously.

&nbsp;

�Right. We better get you out of there.��


&nbsp;

She started by unfastening all the straps holding my wrists and
arms.� As my hands and arms were stiff
and trembling the officer unfastened the locks at the back of my head to
release it from the chair back.� I realised
that she must have been in contact with Beth to have the keys.

Slowly she unfastened the head harness and at last I was able to move my
jaw now that my mouth was free of that infernal ball-gag but I was able to
talk.� I don�t know what I garbled to the
police officer other than to ask where my wife was.

&nbsp;

Maybe I wasn�t making sense because she continued to release all the
other bindings and soon had me completely free of the thick black leather
straps that had held me immobile.� My
arms and legs tingled with pins and needles as the straps were unbuckled.

&nbsp;

I tried to stand up from the chair but a combination of weakness and
severe cramps made me sit down quickly. I started to flex my aching muscles.

&nbsp;

The gaze of the officer lowered and I realised that I had a huge erection
that was trapped flat against my body by the thick black rubber suit; as if I
wasn�t humiliated enough this made it even worse. I tried to move to cover the
sight of the embarrassing bulge, but any movement made it worse.� If I stood up it would be even more prominent
so I just sat there and hoped that it would subside. But of course it
wouldn�t!!!

&nbsp;

The policewoman handed me a bottle of water that I took gratefully.

&nbsp;

�� I suppose that this is some sort
of a sex game is it?�

&nbsp;

� Yes. �It was a bet with my wife
that I wouldn�t dare to do it.� But where
is she? She was supposed to come and free me late last evening; what�s happened
to her?�

&nbsp;

�I am afraid that your wife was involved in a traffic accident.� She is not seriously injured but has a broken
arm and some few cuts and bruises and the hospital has decided that she should
stay in for tests and further X-rays to make sure that she is not suffering
from concussion. � 

&nbsp;

I was shocked and could only manage to mumble almost incoherently. � Are
you sure that she is alright?�.

&nbsp;

�Yes please believe me.� She will
be just fine. Apart from the arm and the minor cuts I think that she is just
suffering from the shock of the accident.�
She seemed more worried about you and told me where you were�.. and that
you were well�.., shall we say playing games?

&nbsp;

Relieved to hear this I asked if I could go and change out of the suit
and boots.

&nbsp;

The constable smiled humorously and again her eyes lowered to my
crotch.� I stood up and the worst
happened, my erection forced it�s way forward as I got to my feet and the
clingy latex suit exacerbated the situation. I hurried red faced to the office
to change into jeans and a sweater.

I came back out and started to gather up all the bondage equipment and
load it into the holdall.� After taking
the bag into the office I started to manoeuvre�
the heavy chair towards the office when the officer took one side and
helped me move it off the platform.

&nbsp;

I locked all the doors and we left the station to climb in the police
car. There was still a great deal of confusion in my mind and I asked. She said
that it was about nine o�clock; I had apparently
been in that scene for nearly fifteen hours.

&nbsp;

Another squall of heavy rain swept across us as she drove away and I
asked if we could go straight to the hospital. She told me that was where she
was going but later she would need a statement from both my wife and me.

&nbsp;

I asked if they were going to charge me with anything.

&nbsp;

The police-woman said that it was something that would be decided after
she had interviewed us but since there was no damage done, just trespassing
seemed likely.� She said not to worry and
that we wouldn�t be going to prison.� She
laughed as she said it and I couldn�t help but see the humour in that remark.

&nbsp;

As she parked the car at the hospital she told me where to find Beth and
I asked her when the accident had happened.

&nbsp;

�Oh about� seven o�clock yesterday evening �,�
she said as she strode off.

&nbsp;

I stood there for a moment and then it hit me that it must have happened
on her way home from dealing with me. My mind raced.� �Then�
who the hell had been on the station platform last night?� 

I couldn�t believe it so I raced after the constable. 

&nbsp;

�Are you sure about the time of the accident?�

&nbsp;

She pulled out a notebook and flipped the pages and there it was in black
and white.� The accident had been
reported to the police at 7.21 pm� and that meant the accident must have
occurred shortly before then.� I thanked
her and walked into the hospital. 

&nbsp;

Beth was sitting on a bed in the ward looking sorry for herself; her arm
was in plaster and she looked white and drawn.�
She assured me that that she was really not badly hurt and felt even
better now that she knew that I was free. We discussed it for some time and
decided to leave it until later in the day to talk in detail about what
happened to each other.� So I left her as
the nurses came to change the dressings on her cuts.

&nbsp;

As I walked down the hospital corridor, I wondered what the hell had
occurred last night. 

&nbsp;

I convinced myself after some time that I must have dropped off and
dreamt about the other visitor and what happened.� The more I considered this the more it had to
be the only sensible answer.

&nbsp;

At home I went straight upstairs to shave and have a shower before
getting some sleep. As I stripped off my shirt and stood in front of the mirror
to shave, I was shocked to see that my nipples had been painted with a deep
crimson lipstick.

&nbsp;

I ripped down my trousers and looked at my penis; the head was also deep
red.

&nbsp;

�Oh Christ�.� If Beth was in
hospital who the hell did this?�� 

&nbsp;

Then I thought back to Beth telling me that as soon as she woke up after
the accident she told had the constable about our game and where I was then
gave her the keys.� But that would have
been around nine o�clock!�� That morning, as the officer had opened my
