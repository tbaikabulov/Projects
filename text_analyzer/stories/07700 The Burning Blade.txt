The Burning Blade
By Whisper
PROLOGUE:

He could feel the darkness. Always it was there, sometimes waiting like a lover of the ages, patiently biding its time until the moment when it could embrace him. Other times, it hungered, drawing him in leaving him feeling powerless and weak. How long ago had it changed? When did the darkness leave him, abandon him and walk away, while he stood silently in this void. The cold, silent and heartless darkness had been long lasting. It held no passion, no hate, no love, no emotion... nothing at all. Yes, it had been a very long lasting void indeed. The darkness he could feel now though sent shivers through him. He could feel the darkness at last, and so much more along with it. Heat, chilled breezes, stars, lights to let you appreciate the darkness when you looked away... It had been too long.
He stepped onto sand, for the first time in a very long time, and simply stood, staring at the sky, star filled and bright, wondering at how much time had changed, moulded, this place in his absence. He was a thing of the night yet. It would be a while before he became substantial enough to be seen and felt. Though, if he had indeed had a face his expression would have been a mixture of sorrow, relief and joy, with tears marking his visage. The moments stretched to minutes, which in turn stretched to hours, and eventually, many hours later he moved. A local traveller, one of the many nomads who still roamed these barren worlds, for that is what they are in a way, saw the shifting shadow and gazed up at the sky looking for a bird, for there was nothing there to cast a shadow and the night was too clear for it to be a cloud, not to mention that a cloud that small could hardly cast a shadow the size of a standing man. His eyes focused and he squinted as he guided his camel down the dune to investigate. Water and food was scarce and not often found in this wilderness, and he hardly wanted to pass what could be an opportunity to gain some much needed resources. 
He arrived at the point, and after many decades on the dunes, he knew the sands and could plot the spot easily enough, and found nothing. It had gone. As the confused nomad turned circles argued silently with himself and truly shaken resumed his course west, the shadow moved on winds unseen and with footsteps unheard towards a different west, one which would wake him with its beliefs, practices and knowledge. He would wake and he would live, but this time, he would not fade into the void, for that was unacceptable to him. The worst torture imaginable and he would not allow himself to fall once again into the cursed nothingness from which he had just come. He would live.

BOOK 1: EVER PRESENT DARKNESS
CHAPTER 1

�It&#8217;s been a long week Becca,� said Richard Brent softly as he sighed and leaned back on the chair, already considering that he might indeed have to get up and go out. He rubbed one hand across his face and rubbed his cheek checking to see if there was any stubble he would need to shave.
�Maybe, but I&#8217;ll make a deal with you,� came the soft voice of Rebecca Mercy over the phone as she began her purring contralto. �You come out and I&#8217;ll treat you to the lovely sight of me all decked out in a school girl outfit.�
Richard chuckled and knew he had guessed right and that he would indeed be heading out tonight. He didn&#8217;t particularly dislike Halloween. It was just that given an option he would have rather spent the night enjoying a few beers at the local pub with a few of the regulars rather than parading around strangers&#8217; crowded homes making polite chit chat and sipping slowly from whatever horrible tasting punch they had created this year, lying through his teeth about how lovely it was to a host who was too tipsy to see the truth and giggling too often. Well, it could be worse; he thought silently to himself, the host could be him.
�I don&#8217;t have a costume,� he said trying not to sound relieved at the revelation and failing miserably.
�Put on a suit and call yourself a lawyer Richard. Or do you not want to see me in a tiny plaid skirt?� said a mock-wounded Rebecca.
�Fine, fine, give me half an hour,� muttered Richard as he got up and headed into the shower, turning off the phone and going to get ready.
He looked at himself and thought for a moment. He wasn&#8217;t bad looking, though for the life of him he could say he was good looking either. He was decent. He chuckled at that thought as he moved to shower. Most people, upon realising some of his thoughts and fantasies would label him all sorts of things so far from decent it seemed funny. After all, how many men fantasised about being dressed up and disguised as a dumb blonde, only to be discovered in a bar, raped by all the men and kept as a pet by a woman who found him cum filled on the floor passed out, later that night?
Truly Richard Brent was a bit more than decent. He was fit for his 32 years of age and it showed. He was the smallest bit less than six feet tall and had the build of a swimmer, slim waist, broad shouldered and thick legged. His face was clean cut but not sharp and his eyes were deep blue. His service in the army of the United States of America had left him with his share of scars, the most prominent of which was on his back. A search and rescue mission that had gone bad and an interrogation squad that was not opposed to torture had left him with a curving scar from his upper right shoulder down to his waist where the skin had been slit open and salt stuffed into the wound in an attempt to get him to talk. He&#8217;d been honourably discharged since then despite the fact that he had given up nothing, for the simple reason that people didn&#8217;t know how well he might hold up if he got caught a second time with state secrets too important to risk. So he had gone back home to find his family had died a couple of years ago, and he ha d to find work or turn into a homeless bum. He picked the former and was now working in the programming department of a software development firm and living comfortably if not wealthily.
Rebecca Mercy on the other hand, was another ball game. She was stunning, in the strawberry blonde way that most women would die for. It didn&#8217;t help that she was a bigger geek than he was and had refused the advances of her employers through the years to rise steadily in the company through sheer skill, determination and hard work. Richard had held a soft spot for the woman since he had found out her father had died in the Vietnam war, her mother shortly after through grief and she had been raised in an orphanage. Perhaps normally a relative might have taken her in, but being disowned on her father&#8217;s side for marrying a &#8216;black woman&#8217; and her mother&#8217;s side having no family, her chances had been slim indeed.
Now, as he drove to Rebecca&#8217;s house, he couldn&#8217;t help but wonder just how close their friendship had gotten. They were more than &#8216;just&#8217; friends, they were so much more. Not lovers, but more akin to best friends. He sighed as he realised that even though he mightn&#8217;t mind risking their friendship to attempt something more, Rebecca might think less of him for the attempt and such a relationship could hardly last and would soon turn sour. He shook his head and argued the inconsistencies of that statement all the way to Rebecca&#8217;s house.

She twirled in the mirror and watched her reflection critically. It wasn&#8217;t that she was too concerned with her looks, but rather that she just wanted to make sure everything was just right. The leggy, five feet eight inches of strawberry blonde, amber eyed woman staring back at her was not exactly ugly. She cleaned up well, she knew. Better than most women these days who either doused themselves in make up or preened over themselves for hours and hours every day. She&#8217;d known Richard for nearly two years and in all that time he was the only person who seemed to truly understand her. Her frown seemed one out of sheer confusion as she stopped twirling and thought once more of the source of her anxiety that night. She wasn&#8217;t nervous. There wasn&#8217;t much that made her nervous, but the thought of her plan of action for the night didn&#8217;t sit too spectacularly with her either. She knew she had to make the first move, and she knew they could never quite be &#8216;fuck buddies&#8217;, but if this didn&#8217;t work she didn&#8217;t honestly think she&#8217;d recover quite that easily. She&#8217;d survive, as she always had, but a lot of her bluster for life would be eradicated.
The horn told her it was time to go and quickly grabbing her house keys, she left the house. She&#8217;d decided against make up and a purse for the simple reason that she liked the idea of a schoolgirl through and through. She did (luckily) have her clip on I.D. tag from work that stated her address and name so that any problems with the authorities would be cleared up easily enough. She slipped it all around her neck and down her blouse as she got into Richard&#8217;s car.

They got to the party relatively soon and after nearly half an hour found themselves on the balcony overlooking the acreage in the back. The mansion was large but the land it was on was vast. They seemed content to stand there, had it not been the awkwardness in the air. Both knew something was happening but neither knew what. Rebecca broke the feeling first. Things, she thought silently, had to move forward or go back to the way they were, because this awkwardness was inacceptable.
�Let&#8217;s go for a walk,� she said as she smiled at Richard and headed down a set of stairs on one side.
Richard looked around, wondering if this was really all right and working out the logistics, for a quick getaway as well as whether anyone might let the owner know and his reaction. Finding no one who was looking in on them and guessing that the owner wouldn&#8217;t mind anyway set his mind at ease.
�Richard,� said Rebecca silently, with something in her voice that made him move before he had even thought of it.
There was a clear sky tonight, and the moon gazed down at them with its half shut eye watching them walk towards the woods silently. Both their thoughts were moving a mile a second and it didn&#8217;t take long for them to reach the woods. They walked a bit deeper in silence, wondering, and thinking, weighing the factors and points in their minds. Were they doing the right thing? Was it too late to turn back? Did they want to?
Rebecca couldn&#8217;t take it any longer.
�Richard,� she said as she turned to him and they gazed at each other for a second.
Would she turn away if she found out what he wanted? Would it turn her stomach? Would there be a better time? Richard&#8217;s thoughts hammered through his head with all the delicacy of a bullet train hitting a grown man head on, going full speed. But he could feel something on the night air. Maybe it was the drink, or perhaps the sight of Rebecca standing there cloaked in moonlight, or perhaps it was something else. He hardly knew, nor for that matter, cared anymore. He dropped to his knees, his hands clasped behind his back and head bowed.
The sharp intake of breath caught him before he could second guess himself, and looking up, he realised that that was a good thing. Rebecca gazed down at him with burning eyes. They would have flashed in the night, glowed even, if she were a cat. Instead, they burnt. The small white blouse barely contained her breasts as they heaved and the white bra showed clearly through the flimsy top in the moonlight. Her mouth was open, parted slightly and her tongue unconsciously ran over her lips as she gazed at the man kneeling before her. She stepped towards him and in two steps was standing inches from his face, his neck now bent, as he stared up, back arched and sighed, barely containing the moan in his throat.
She ran her fingers delicately across his face, and then the tenderness vanished in the midst of their need. Her fingers gripped his jaw tightly, holding him in place as she bent down and kissed him hard and deep, biting his lips and drawing a small drop of blood. She moaned, feeling him shiver under her touch and stood up quickly. Panting, Richard could only hold his place as his body shivered in anticipation.
�Lick,� whispered Rebecca as she lifted a leg and placed it on his shoulder, her heels resting squarely on him, her hands roaming her own body that seemed to be consumed by need, so hot was it.
�Yes Mistress,� he murmured as he turned his head and ran his tongue over the leg, suddenly finding his throat dry and breathing heavily. He licked her calf, moved lower and then higher, over her shin and back to her calf, struggling to keep steady and lick as much as he could in his position.
�Use your hands slave,� she whispered, eliciting a moan as a response. Richard reached around, and grabbed her leg, licking it slowly as his hands held it steady. He licked higher, going over her knee, behind it, letting his tongue wander down to her ankles and feet, then back up, over and over. His pace increased as did the sight of his submission fuel their lust, and it wasn&#8217;t long before Rebecca was sitting back against a tree, toying with her breasts as he continued to lick her leg.
She could feel her body thrumming. Every touch seemed to go straight to her clitoris, making her throb and burn there. The moans escaping her lips at the sight of Richard, eyes closed and lapping at her legs were sheer passion and the sight made her open her shirt.
�Look at me,� she whispered as she slowly teasingly unbuttoned her shirt and peeled it away, taking off her bra next and slowly, ever so slowly moving it away to reveal her breasts. She was a D cup but an average to small D cup. She had full breasts, but firm ones. Not sticking out like conical pieces of cardboard, but not sagging too much either. Richard moaned and nearly fell back swooning.
�You like that do you, slave?� purred Rebecca as her legs wrapped around his neck. �Come and have a taste then,� she murmured, pulling him closer with her legs.
Richard didn&#8217;t need the help, and pounced on the opportunity, licking and suckling them, teasing the nipples out and toying with them in his mouth. His teeth grazed one nipple, his tongue flicking across it as he sucked the breast in his mouth, his hands just reaching for them, only to be caught by Rebecca. �Did I say you could use hands?� she purred contentedly as she pushed him back and stood. �You need to be punished for that. Get up and strip,� she purred as she watched him.
�Yes Mistress,� murmured Richard looking down. He knew she had expected it, baited him even, purposely not warning him, letting him reach until he was too close to deny it and then using it against him. �Sorry Mistress,� he said softly as he stood and looked down, hands behind his back, contrite at having made an error so soon.
She said nothing. She walked around him, letting her nails trail gently over his shoulders and back until she came back to stand in front of him. �Spread your legs and bend over against the tree,� she commanded, for there was no other word for it. Silently, he obeyed, doing as directed. He felt shudders coarse through his body at her tone. She was forceful enough that it made him forget everything other than his submission. The cold night air brought the first hint of cold, and was summarily dismissed as the whistle of a switch cut through the air.
Rebecca felt the air cut by the makeshift switch as the sapling whipped across his ass. She felt her clit throb even harder as she heard him gasp, but maintain his position. Another strike brought a moan from him and a quiver along his back. The third stole his breath, leaving him shaking where he stood. The pain was substantial, for the sapling was thin enough to sting fiercely but not cut skin... yet. The switch fell ten times before she finished.
�Such a good boy,� she purred again into his ear as she moulded herself over his back and gripped his hair in one hand, forcing his head back farther while her other hand reached between his legs from behind to toy with the balls hanging under him. �Does my horny slut slave need some attention?� she whispered, grabbing his cock in one hand and twisting it back between his legs just as she suddenly let go of his head, leaving him leaning against the tree for support and gasping.
�Yes Mistress,� he stammered between gasps while she crouched behind him and proceeded to rub some of his pre cum from the tip of his cock.
Her smile broadened at his reply and se quickly slipped one moist finger into his ass, eliciting a loud moan from him. His head exploded into a thousand tiny stars, and he had to ground himself back into his body to keep from cumming right there and then.
�Good,� she murmured as she jerked her fingers out, drawing a grunt from him this time. Her fingers went into his mouth and she told him to suck them clean, which he did moaning and panting all the while.
Once he was finished, she turned him around and pushed him to the ground, straddling him before he could wonder at the change in position. Her panties pushed aside, she wasted no time and planted herself on his nearly painfully hard member in seconds, moaning loudly as she did so. �Don&#8217;t you dare cum until I tell you to,� she purred as she began to ride him. Slowly at first, for he wasn&#8217;t small and she was feeling every one of his eight thick inches embedded deep inside her. Things progressed fairly quickly though and soon she was pounding herself on top of him thrusting down harder and harder, one hand squeezing her breasts while the other rubbed her clitoris and within minutes her first orgasm hit her. Clenching down around him and screaming, grinding her clit and fingers against his pelvis she paused as she recovered, and quickly turned around, keeping him inside her, the movement bringing aftershocks of pleasure through her pussy. Again the riding began, faster and faster, at an ever increasing pace the moved, until they set a rhythm.
�Please let me cum Mistress,� begged Richard between moans and gasps, desperately holding on the last edge of self control he had.
�Oooooohh,� moaned Rebecca as she moved her wet fingers to his ass getting the timing and positioning just right. �Does my little slut slave boy want to cum?� she asked as she grind her hips around his cock, shuddering and clamping around him feeling the build up of several orgasms reaching a head. �Then cum slave,� she moaned and screamed, once again lifting and falling on his cock hard and fast, but resuming just as she jabbed one finger into Richard deep and hard, searching for and quickly finding that spot inside a man to make him cum.
Unable to resist or hold on and not wanting to, Richard gasped and lost all his breath as his climax washed over him. For a long while they stayed that way, Rebecca sitting on Richard and Richard nearly on the edge of passing out from the intensity of his climax. Never had either of them felt anything like it. She had squirted all over him and his sperm was trickling out around his still hard cock inside her.
Then he stepped from the darkness.
His skin was pale, and his eyes the green of the most starling vividness. He seemed human from a distance for his skin glowed. Not like a torch, but the softest gentlest glow, a natural glow, like that of a warm summer day. His hair flowed down his back in light waves of brown, a gentle auburn that accentuate his glow and made it seem less unnatural. Should not everyone in the world have skin like that, pure and beautiful? Neither of the two on the forest floor noticed that it glowed, nor would anyone else unless they looked at it closely, and then they would also see the lines and runes carved along his body from languages long lost to our world. He stood a little over six feet tall and was built perfectly. Barely any fat covered his wide shoulder and muscular arms, his torso seemed cut from stone itself... the legs that supported it seemed an artist&#8217;s work in fluidity. Hardly surprising then, that he seemed not to walk, but to glide? As though that were not enough, there was the weight behind those eyes. Wisdom and knowledge the likes of which humans were not meant to comprehend. Perhaps the human mind can take a great deal more than it does, but that gaze said clearly what all humans know. Some things are not meant for us. They gazed into the face of something that was not human and drowned in it. He was not a vampire, he was not some alien. No, they thought silently and arrived at the same conclusion. This was but a fraction of what he was. You could sense it in the very air. The night itself seemed to come alive for him, wolves howling in the distance, owl hooting where there had been none before. He smiled then, reading their thoughts as easily as if they had spoken them aloud.
�I am Erinaes,� he spoke in a voice that seemed to be honey and cinnamon, the lushness of spring and depth of snowy winters all at once, a voice that warmed you to the tips of your toes and froze you in place just as easily. That voice you could spend an eternity listening to, and it would still be as humbling and awe inspiring as the first time you heard it.
I am Erinaes, he had said. But what that meant, was yet to come...










THE BURNING BLADE

By Whisper



CHAPTER 2 - REVELATIONS





The sun would be rising soon, thought Eraenis somberly, breaking away from his train of thoughts, if only for a moment. Jumping down from his perch on a branch with enough grace to put a cat to shame, he began his walk towards the patch of open grass by the stream, his thoughts swirling within his head. Looking at him, one could not see the conflict within this being, but would instead see the beauty and grace of the setting. Dawn was breaking, and the last remnants of the clear night were left as traces in the forms of long, soft shadows and dew, icing the grass, so as to make the very ground seem to shimmer in the slight glow of his skin. His hair floated as easily as mist behind him and it seemed he walked effortlessly and silently, not once slipping or stumbling on the wet and moist ground, nor stepping into ditches or muds.


But he was thinking quite a bit and paid little attention to his surroundings. After all, how could he? Everytime he had been on this world, he had a reason. To teach someone something, to show this world a great error it had made, to fight for one cause or another. Never before had he had misgivings, greatly because never before had he seen so much blood littering the very ground, the same he had sworn to protect. He pushed away those memories and re-focused his attentiont on the present. His night of excursions had lasted a few moments. Only the time it had taken him to step onto a rock and concentrate ever so slightly on the ground. He had expected having to sit peacefuly for hours, meditating in his trance like state to understand his purpose this time, to speak with the very Earth itself, but that had hardly been necessary. The Earth seemed to be calling him, eagerly, frantically even, to show him his purpose. How he had wept when he realised what had happened, and how he had wanted to rage. What had the humans done? How badly had they scarred this world they called theirs.


He knew what he would have to do. It would take a long time to set the road that they might right the wrongs that had been done, but it would be done. His confusion came not from his purpose. It would be done, and the world would be cleansed, but the thought of his last battle weighed heavily on his mind. Eraenis had spoken true when he had said that he had never meant Rebecca or Richard any harm. Circumstances on the other hand, it seemed, had already decided to throw those two in the line of fire. But how could he risk the lives of others, those that were not his to risk? No, he decided, he could not. If necessary, he would fight this alone. Deep inside his heart, though, he knew he could not. He would then be not only risking himself but too much along with it for the gamble to be even close to worth it. This seemed inacceptable though he did not truly decide it yet, and would gladly risk himself if it helped to save those two.


His thoughts continued in their tumultous fashion, with Ereanis fighting back old memories and thinking of ways in which to solve his problem without endangering too many people, while he knelt by the stream and drank the crisp, clear and cold water. In truth, he was so absorbed in his pondering that he hardly noticed the sunrise, only to be startled when a squirrel scurried beside him and lapped at the water from it's rocky perch. It seems, he thought wryly, his smile content for the time being, his decision reached as he stroked the squirrels back and enjoyed the more simple pleasures of being whole again, that he could only talk it through with Rebecca and Richard. They had a connection to him, and knew this world a lot better than he did. After an eplanation he felt certain they would have a few ideas and perhaps a solution could be found that kept all parties safe. Perhaps it was blind hope, or maybe prudent planning, but somehow Eraenis knew, that he could not involve more people until he had talked to them and a peaceful solution reached. With this thoughts settled, he got up and turned, using a bit of energy to locate the two and then smiling at the sight of them entwined in bed, content and peaceful, caring only about each other. He felt a twinge of guilt, for he truly did not wish to disturb the loving couple, and nearly abandoned his plan, but held firm when he considered the alternatives and likely blood shed that those alternatives might mean.


---


She blinked as the sunlight streamed through the drapes and fell lightly across her face and his chest. The nail and teeth marks standing out clearly against his shoulder and chest, the sun light seeming to kiss them lightly and make her warm all over. She felt the warm coils of lust in her belly at the thought of what they had done yesterday night. They had reached the house and after an hour of rest and a meal later, had found themselves back where they had started, making love and teasing until several hours later, both had colapsed on the bed, too ehausted to even speak and fell asleep. Those thoughts also brought with them the reminders of why they had come home so much earlier than expected and Eraenis.


She frowned as there came a soft knock on the door, wondering who it could be so early in the morning, only to glance at the clock and see that it wasn't quite that early, but rather half past eight in the morning. It seemed wise to wake up the sleeping Richard, but Rebecca decided against it, knowing she had pushed her lover hard and fast last night, and he could probably use the rest, and so silently got out of the bed and went to retrieve a pair of his slacks and shirt, since they seemed closest and easiest to put on. She couldn't find her panties, and had a suspicion that answering the door bright and early in another man's house in her skirt with no panties might not be the smartest thing to do.


"I'm sorry," began Rebecca, her words trailing off in a whimper at the sight of him.


Her imagination had not exaggerated his appearance, and if anything had not quite done it justice. Eraenis stood there, in a sea of calm serenity that only seemed to inspire her trust in him, and smiled softly at her. He was dressed rather... conservatively, given that he was not even human. The morning did have a chill breeze in the air, but was by no means cold enough to warrant a coat. The black leather fell of his perfect shoulders with the ease of someone who had spent decades wearing it. It looked the part too, the leather having aged well, smooth and creased to the contours of his body. The collar seemed loose, not stiff like most of the modern day leather coats, and instead of seeming stifling, looked more like it would keep your body temperature just right... not too hot, neither leave you to the cold. Her gaze inadvertently went down, as she followed the line of his hips, where the coat dropped down, hiding his legs while he stood still only revealing his boots poking out from underneath the coat. They too had the worn and hardy look of good boots, very, very good boots, she thought silently, that had been worn for decades. Snapping back to the present and berating herself for so easily loosing her train of thoughts at the sight of him, she looked up at him. Up, she thought, once again loosing track of the situation and marvelling at just how stunningly gorgeous that face was. To Rebecca, Eraenis suddenly seemed a whole lot taller to her and once again she had to force herself to the matter at hand, trying quickly to recall everything that had happened the night before, including everything he said. Not an easy task, since she had been so close to dropping onto her knees before him that she had hardly registered a lot of what was said.


"I have brought you breakfast," he said smiling at her as he stepped into the house beside her, with a rather amused smile on his face. He was used to getting looks from both women and men, and with a thought could usually draw such looks from those that secoonds ago, had not even noticed him standing beside them. However, the many, many images Rebecca seemed to be throwing at him, even if involuntarily, made her struggle for control and reasoning power seem rather ... amusing. After all, a woman who would much rather throw herself upon his feet, kissing them and begging for him to use her to satisfy himself, than ask him who and what he was, and what he was doing here seemed very opposed to controlling at that point. Silently commending her for being on of the few people who had inadvertently evaded his call twice now, he sat on the lounger and smiled up at the now shivering Rebecca.


She knew he was not here to harm them. Quite the opposite, since he had coming bringing breakfast, and for the simple fact that if he wanted them, dead or alive, he would have little trouble taking them. With a start that woke her from her trance rather sharply, she realised that his very presence made her (and if last night was any indication, Richard as well) want to please him. They had been fighting it because sub consciously they had known he was a stranger, not human and the loss of control could be very dangerous. That, coupled with the fact that they had very little knowledge on just how to handle the situation spelled trouble in big bold letters. With an exclamation and underscore, she added silently as he smiled and tilted his head. This gave her, her second revelation. He was following her thoughts as easily as though she were speaking them aloud. Gritting her teeth and taking a soft breath she quickly came to three conclusions: First, he truly did not wish them harm, yet. Second, it seemed smart and prudent to find out as much as she could before that changed. Third, perhaps Richard should be woken.


"Yes," he murmured with approval. Perhaps, these two wouldn't quite be that helpless. "Go and wake him up. What I have to say concerns both of you and I need you both fully awake and fresh, so please do freshen up any way you choose to. I will wait and perhaps set the table?" he finished with the rather curious and rather odd sounding question.


It seemed absolutely absurd to Rebecca that He set the table. Followed sharply on the heels of that thought came the question on why she had just called him a 'He' and why setting the table seem so absurd? With a shake of her head at the far too many revelations, she muttered under her breath, "whatever..." and quickly made her way into the bedroom to wake Richard up. Surprisingly, she found him still asleep. Though the fact that Ereanis was in the house and now looking around the kitchen, seemed akin to an earthquake taking place inside her head. She frowned, realising that it truly was so and not just her imagination. Her mind seemed shaken and as it settled, she found herself focusing and attentive to a rather higher degree than she normally was, which in itself was considerable considering just how sharp she usually was.


Richard woke as she was half way to the bed, frowned for half a second as he sat up and then felt his eyes go wide. He had been having rather pleasant dreams of Rebecca, himself and fireplaces, when suddenly he felt his own mind jerking into consciousness, of its own accord, and even eagerly, and had found himself wanting to wake up gladly. His frown came from the sudden alertness in his mind, the lack of memories regarding his last dreams and of course, the sight of Rebecca in his clothes looking a bit to pale, slightly worried, more frustrated and angry, and even more - scared. Then he felt it. He looked up wide eyed at Rebecca and she only silently nodded, as easily reading his thoughts from his facial expression and guessing that, somehow, Richard knew Ereanis was in the kitchen. Whether it was reasoning skills, intuition, gut instincts or something else altogether, she didn't know, but made it a point to find out.


"Richard, we need a strategy and need one soon." she whispered urgently as she got up and locked the door to the bedroom unconsciously. Then shaking her head and giving a sarcastic laugh, she turned back and sat on the bed, knowing as well as Richard that the door seemed a flimsy and insignificant thing when contrasted with the being in the other room.


"What's been happening and why didn't you wake me?" asked Richard, not accusingly but urgently as he rubbed his head and took a few deep breaths to calm himself and take stock of the situation.


"I didn't know it was him when he knocked, and yes he did indeed knock on your door and walk in. I decided to let you sleep since you were probably tired. Also, I doubt he means us harm and he's got breakfast." she finished silently shaking her head at the last part.


"Knock? Breakfast? What..." he asked in sheer confusion.


"I'll explain while I get washed up," asnwered Rebecca heading to the bathroom and stripping on her way. neither of them were thinking of sex but the sight of the woman dropping her clothes with that fluid grace made Richards stomach twist with lust. Reminding himself of their situation and forcing his reactions down he stepped into the bathroom beside Rebecca and joined her at the sink as she washed her face.


"He really doesn't mean us harm. He could have us any way he wanted, willingly, but he hasn't done anything to force or coerce us in anyway. He can read our thoughts, and this is a guess, he can also control just how much he... 'affects' us whenever we're around him. I think we need to ask him a few questions and find out where we stand in all this. Somehow, I doubt hostility towards him will make him harm us, but I neither want to offend and anger him, nor not know just what exactly is going on. We need to talk and find out just where we stand." she finished as she headed into the shower area.


"You're having a bath," asked Richard with raised eyebrows after nodding absentmindedly to himself and registering everything she had said, and suddenly realising that the shower was on. It seemed a bit confusing to him that she would be having a shower while some sort of being was wandering around the kitchen. He was about to say so when she answered his thought for him.


"He wants us to be 'fresh' since he has something he would like to talk to us about. Mind you," she said poking her face out of the shower, water dripping down her face, "he said talk not tell, so I'm assuming we have some say in the matter. Brush your teeth and get ready Richard, I'd like to get out there as soon as I can too, but I actually agree with him on the point that we might as well be fresh and use every advantage we can get today."


Richard sighed and wondered if it was good or bad luck that sheer timing had caused everything to happen at once. Rebecca, he had liked for a while, if not loved at least as a friend, and for better and worse, there was suddenly a stranger throwing all the chances, expectations and normality out the window. Thanks to Eraenis, they had moved farther in a day than they would have in a month under 'normal' circumstances, yet the uncertainty and confusion seemed only bound to cause some sort of problem or the other later. He spent a few moments arguing that they could handle anything so long as they were willing to work at it and the practicality of a military man stating that this would definetely unsettle things at least a bit. Silently he came to the conclusion that things might not go as expected, but that most things could be solved and it would only be a matter of taking things as they came.


Soon, Richard was standing in front of the mirror, head bowed, hands in the air, wrists together, while Rebecca stood behind him, buttoning his shirt up for him in silence. Finished with that she turned him around with her fingers directing his movements, lowerd his arms behind his back and nodded approvingly. It hadn't taken either of the two very long to decide that this would be a lovely time for Rebecca to dress up her new slave. She had picked a pair of dark green khakhi's and a light, tan coloured shirt that accented his skin well. She herself had remained in a pair of his slack and a work shirt since she had no other clothes. Straighteing his shirt and smiling softly, she nodded at him as she dragged his face lower with a firm grip on his jaw and stole a kiss from the surprised man. She thrust her tongue in his mouth, grinding it against his and licking along the inside of his mouth, taking in the taste of him as he moaned deep in his throat. The sound drew a soft, half purr half growl from her own throat and she bit down on his lower lip, sucking and nibbling on it before she suddenly let him go and smiled wickedly at the suddenly weak kneed Richard and gave on tug on his pants, silently signalling he should follow her as she turned around and walked out of the bedroom. They paused and looked at each other, anxiousness and worry creasing their faces in frowns as they both mentally prepared themselves for the confrontation. A deep breath and sigh later, they opened the door and entered the living room.


Eraenis smiled to himself, barely holding back a chuckle at the sight, sat silently in one of the chairs around the small table in the kitchen. Rebecca seemed to have as much of a desire as she had initially when he had appeared at their doorstep, though she had more control with Richard so close behind her. The sight of the man following silently and gracefully behind her told Ereanis a lot. He was a fighter that one, he thought silently and smiled a bit more softly and less amusingly, as he watched Richards steps. Graceful, careful, well place and sure footed, in his own home. He understood that though the man may not be invincible, he would be a very dangerous foe to many and silently applauded Rebecca, yet again, on finding someone so strong and well suited to her own fiery and fierce spirit. His attention turned to Rebecca once more and noticed that she had gained not only a bit of control, but also peace, wisdom and strength from her partner. Just as Richard had gained a massive amount of strength, surety and confidence from her. More and more, Ereanis found himself glad for his choice. These two were not only strong and smart, but complimented each other so well in so many ways, that he very much doubted he would find better to help him.


"Ereanis, I don't think we've introduced ourselves. Since no one seems to know where to begin, why don'tzwe start there?" asked Rebecca after taking a deep breath and plunging in, having waited for a handful of moments wherein the silence seemed to stretch rather long.


Ereanis had been sitting silently, watching Richard and Rebecca for a while, smiling all the time, now only chuckled softly. That sound alone sent shivers thzrough both Rebecca and Richard. It souded like the sound of a stream in some fantasy land, more akin to nature itself than a sound made by people. Again, the newly founded couple wondered what exactly it was that had knocked on their door, metaphorically speaking. "You are Rebecca Mercy and the handsome, and quite lucky, man by your side whose house this is, is Richard Brent. You both compliment each other spectacularly and I know about the both of you than either of you think." he said. "I could find out more about your pasts, but I have little reason or cause. Should you wish to tell me one day, I will be glad to know more of both of you, but until that fated morn, I cannot see why I might need to know." he finished as he stood up and walked to the veranda's glass doors behind his chair. "You must be wondering what I am, and in the interest of progress, I shall try to explain. Your language has no words for me. I was once called something that may not be spoken anymore. It was part of a penance that was to be paid. You see, I have existed in this world since millenia. Always silent and secluded, maintaining a low profile, so to speak. The only times that has changed were when there was great need. I looked over this world, but never interfered unless fate itself demanded it. I love your people, so different from myself, lives in such contrast to mine. Ever I have chosen to protect them should true disaster strike, and ever I have. I am not human, clearly so. My people lived in this world once. We survived by ruling our realms and feeding, searching for happiness just as your people do, though perhaps our means and goals differed greatly. One day, we simply started fading because the source of our life, had begun to fade. Some believed it to be a catastrophe, though more of us believed that it was the world itself slowly and gently moving us aside for a new people. After all, we were immortal and there was nothing that could destroy us. Your people have a phrase these days it seems. 'Mother Nature', I believe it is. Well, we were never judgemental and did not start then. But while most of my people died, I survived, although I sometimes wish it were different. I survived to guard the new race. Human beings were clumsy, ineffectual and crude. They were also love and caring, nurturing their young and full of passions so different from ours. We existed, maybe even lived, but we had long ago lost that legendary passion you humans possess in so much abundance. I enjoyed these humans and helped whenever they required, slowly letting my role diminish and merely watching. I found the joys of parenting, the joys of company and the joys of truly living with passion and not existing or surviving. I still miss my people, but I understand what has to be done and am content now." Ereanis paused and turned to look at Rebecca and Richard, both so enthralled in his story that they had completely forgotten everything else and seemed enraptured. Nodding to himself, he continued.


"I contented myself with a quiet existance and watchfulness, only bringing myself to the forefront as I said, in times of great need. But the last time I did so, I erred. My mistake cost many their lives and the ones I had sworn to protect, I could not. In the end, their sacrifice had been unnecessary and the responsibility weighed heavily on me. In my grief and anger I faded until I was no more of this world. You must understand, I sustain my own life's energy by feeding of humanity's emotions. This does not diminish their emotions but is like sunlight to a leaf. A source of energy. Love, lust, anger, grief, fear, contentment, joy... all emotions affect me and it took years of practice to only accept certain emotions. The feeling of loss, of loosing so many loved ones so suddenly was something I had never experienced, and the fact that I had failed in my responsibility only added to the guilt. Then, recently I was awoken and brought back for there is another time of need. I am glad to be back, at a chance to redeem myself, but I fear more blood in my hands. You see," said Ereanis, his tone suddenly grave and face lost of all mirth, skin as dull as a human's the dark grooved runes visible now on his arms. "It seems that in my absence, some humans have begun to wrought ruin upon the Earth. There is something growing in the bowels of this world, but it is not natural, not a creation of Mother Nature. It is man made and festering, like a wound, and will eventually destroy not just yourselves, but the world." he said as he sat down at the table again. "The world will truly die. It will stop dancing around the sun, your physics laws will no longer hold and the very forces of nature will turn upon everything, storms to cleanse, deep freezes lasting centuries to sterilize, and nothing that your people alone might try will stop any of it, or even slow it down." he finished with a finality that sent chills down Richard's back. Rebecca felt the same.


Her thoughts swirled around her. His past seemed truly strange, and she had so many questions she knew instantly that time was needed to digest it all. Why would he lie? Yet, how many questions did she have... they seemed far too many to even count. What of the present situation? The Earth was alive and would die? Extinction? Due to humans? Though the last hardly seemed surprising, given the state people had turned the world into. Somehow, though, Rebecca and Richard both did believe Ereanis and knew that this had nothing to do with pollution or anything they knew of. "There are too many things for us to come to understand here. Too much new information and not enough time to digest it all." stated Richard absently to himself as he came to the same conclusions Rebecca did.


"True," said Ereanis as he stood once again and held out his hand to Richard. "I think you would know more of your world than myself at this point and so, might be able to help. I am reluctant to involve others due to my past. More blood on my hands I do not need. However, I do need help and came to ask you for yours. There is no urgency in terms of time to your people. We have time, though the quicker we finish this the better. Take your time to understand it all and myself. For now I think it would be wise to show you how I feed that you suffer no misunderstandings later." he finished as Richard got up and looked at Rebecca for a moment before taking his hand.


Suddenly the world shifted and Ereanis smiled. It felt as though the world had just sighed and everything was right. Richard couldn't speak, his throat had gone dry, and he looked down to the hand holding his. It occured to him, just how smooth that hand was. It was strong and firm, but so very smooth. Like polished marble, but marble that held heat and light in itself. A small whimper brought his head up slowly, lazily, to look at Rebecca who was struggling in her chair, her knuckles turning white for the effort of gripping the arms of the chair. He frowned slightly wondering why she was so agitated until he looked in her eyes. He read them as easily as Ereanis could read their minds. Lust poured through her in waves, making her wet and hot in seconds.


"I do need to feed," came a voice drawing both their gazes to Ereanis who stepped back and forced his own circle of power back within himself. He understood enough about the two people before him that if he had fed without asking, whatever trust he had built would vanish.


"You stopped," said a breathy Rebecca the minute the lust died down. She was still incredibly wet, open even inside her slacks, already prepared and eager to be penetrated, but able to think and reason. She realised he could have easily had them, again, had he so wished, but had held back. She was not surprised, and having seen the pain in his eyes earlier already knew her answer to the unasked question. "Richard," she stated firmly, drawind Richard's gaze sharply towards her at the tone of voice. "You should not be standing slave."


A gasp escaped the man as he nearly instantly dropped to his knees. The tone that had been used by Rebecca had been unlike anything else he had ever heard from her, not even in their first acts of passion in the woods. No, he thought silently, she was much more today. She got up and walked towards Ereanis, stopping inches from him, forcing herself to look up and look him in the eyes. He looked back down and in that instant, sent her an image of what he would enjoy doing with them. "Yes," she murmured softly and turned back to Richard. She knew what Ereanis wanted and what exactly she had said yes to. He smiled softly and nodded once before leaning down to kiss her. She felt her world explode in sparks as his lips met hers and she moaned into his mouth heavily enough for it to sound like a purr. The feel of his lips pressed against hers, opening her mouth and his tongue grazing her own teasingly slow only made her shiver harder. He tasted like nothing she ahd ever tasted before. Sweet, thick and head spinningly intoxicating. She would have fallen had not his hands wrapped around her and held her as he stopped and stepped back.


"Let us attend to Richard," he said quietly and smiled as he stepped in front of Richard, leading Rebecca by the hand. "Richard," she said softly in a voice that no longer held gentleness, but steel in it. No drill sergeant, no major could have a voice like that, though they would be envious if they ever heard it themselves. Ereanis smiled inwardly at the man's reaction to Rebecca's next words. "Crawl to the room slave, and we will find uses for you." she finished with a purr. The end of the command brought a moan from Richard's throat. The mere thought of being used as a toy for his Mistress' pleasure made his heart pump and chest heave for breath.


Getting on his hands and knees, Richard crawled to the bedroom, very aware that Rebecca and Ereanis were watching him from behind. He wasn't worried though, for the advice coming from Rebecca, made sure that he was well aware that both of them found him incredibly attractive and ensured he presented his ass in the best light.


They reached the bedroom soon enough, and Rebecca immediately grabbed Richards hair, raised him up and tossed him down upon the bed. "Stay there slave," she warned him and turned around to find Ereanis was standing beside one wall that was changed to reveal enough bondage accessories and equipment to stun the woman. It wasn't that she had never seen so many, but that they had appeared out of nowhere. Ereanis with a thought and flare of energy, ensured Rebecca was naked too, her clothes having suddenly disappeared. Rebecca only shook her head and chuckled at Richard's soon to be plight.


Together, with Ereanis doing any of the major lifting and straining far too easily, the bound Richrd across the bed, the man's arms pulled up over his head, tied under the bed, his legs straight, but apart and tied off as well. Then, Ereanis had his clothing disappear, to reveal himself whole and nude. He was not glowing now and though Rebecca and Richard had seen him before, they both found themselves lusting after him even more, now that he was nude. He was semi erect, twitching almost lazily it seemed, and rather large. Slightly more than nine inches, and perfectly smooth, he was curving upwards and seemed to be made of solid honey, a dark and shaded texture. Richard, who had prided himself on being straight (mostly) all his life, found himself overcome with need for him. Rebecca meanwhile, nearly collapsed against the wall at the sight of him, unable to contain the moisture that seemed to trickle down her legs so quickly and so easily. Ereanis himself was well aware of both their needs and played to it perfectly.


"Come Rebecca, why dont we play with our little toy?" he said softly, as he stepped towards her and led her to the bed. Suddenly, Rebecca found herself in complete dominant mode at the sight of Richard stretched across the bed. Immediately, she turned, retrieved a leather cock strap from the wall and proceeded to tie it tightly around the base of Richard's cock and tightened it still more when Ereanis whispered through her mind and told her that he would know when Richard was being harmed and could call a stop to everything without things getting out of hand as well as the fact that he could exchange energy to help heal the man. Richard himself had heard nothing and was about to protest when Ereanis slipped a gag over his mouth, cutting off speech. Next came Rebecca, stepping beside Ereanis with a blindfold and cutting off his vision.


"Now we play," purred Rebecca into Richard's ear before the two moved around to the man's feet


It started slowly. Rebecca climbed onto the bed, and though Richard knew that someone had done just that, the blindfold kept him in the dark (pun intended) as to who it was. The feel of breath against his inner thighs made him moan lightly behind his gag. God, how that smallest of acts made him quiver and quake in his bonds. As if to further his torment, the lips kissed ever so lightly against his skin, forcing his breath to stick in his throat. His skin burned as if he had a fever and the lips responded by moving up, off his body, only to reattach themselves further apart, pressing down, and teeth suddenly digging into his thighs.


"MMMMMMPPPPHHHH!!!" moaned Richard, helpless in his need and aching from how so very hard he was. He would have guessed it was Rebecca from the size of the mouth and bite, had he not been oblivious to the world in that instant, but he was and so he didn't. A tongue pressed against his nipple, licking like a cat would, in long hard strokes, making him whimper with need. The pair of lips and teeth worked him over steadily for some time, drawing small sounds of pleasure, little whimpers and moans from his throat, leaving him trembling in their stead. So aroused was he that he felt aflame, every part of his body sensitive, tingling, almost painfully so, with desire. He never wanted it to stop, craved it so much he could not even hear a thing, save for the rush of blood in his head, the thundering of his heart.


Erineas smiled softly at the sight under him. Richard's skin was flushed and he was panting through his gag, his nose no longer able to provide him enough air, despite its flaring attempts to do so. Erineas could also see the more obvious proof of the man's arousal, his cock, curving straight up before arching down towards his legs, gracefully, and pulsing, twitching and drooling pre cum in response to the gentle teasing.


Rebecca then smiled and got off the bed and walked to the wall to retrieve a crop. Her own hips swayed tantalising, a tell tale sign Erineas knew, of her arousal. She sauntered back to the bed, her eyes smoky with pleasure, licking her lips ever so slightly. Erineas grunted as he opened himself up a bit more and let himself feel, truly feel, the energy in the room, for it was a massive amount. He blinked once forcing himself to sort through it all. Richard was putting out the most, lust pouring from him in large enogh quantities that it truly stunned Erineas. He had never felt such an excess from any living being before. But more surprising was that Rebecca was nearly putting out the same amount. Usually it took months of close contact with specific humans for them to develop such an ability to exude energy so easily and so vast in amount and this turn of events left Ereanis a bit anxious.


Rebecca sensing his anxiousness, though misunderstanding it, made her way to his side, gently going to her knees beside him and laying a kiss on his arm. "I haven't known you for an entire day, Ereanis, but I understand enough of your nature to say that you are not an evil being. Whatever errors have occured, I am sure that you have not wished them." she said in a soft voice, barely above a whisper. He stared at her for the span of a few moments before leaning down, gently and chastly, kissing her lips, in thanks, reminding them both in the process that time for doubts, worries and questions would come later. Reminding them both that the quivering man underneath them was in dire need of attention and had not even heard what she had said.


Ereanis got up, taking Rebecca by the hand and lifting her with him as they made their way back around towards Richards legs. On an impulse, he got behind her, pressing skin to skin and resting his own cock between the cheeks of her ass, and wrapping his own hand around hers, gripping both her and the crop, before whispering in her ear.


"His body is sensitive and some things will be pain," he said, his breath burning against her ear, and suddenly, once again, Rebecca found her mind scrambled, her focus torn between the feel of him pressed against her, the feel of his breath against her ear, his hand on hers and the bound man ahead. Lifting the crop, Ereanis tapped Richard's inner thigh lightly, a grazing touch, teasing the man further, drawing out a whimper from his throat. "There, there and there," he continued in a whisper, not wanting to alert the man and keep him in suspense, as he tapped next the side of his ass centimetres to the right of his throbbing cock. "Those places will give him a lesser sensation. These others will bring him to the edge of pleasure and pain..." he murmured, taking her ear into his mouth and biting down as his hand moved hers and the crop, this time to tap on Richard's testicles, shaft, armpits and nipples. "Go easy on the head, that will be only pain, albeit pleasant pain to him right now." he finished as he stepped back and walked back around to the bound slave's head. He had done the small demonstration because he knew the effect it would have and smiled knowingly as he retrieved a ring gag on his way towards Richard's head.


He took off the gag and bent low, speaking clearly but softly and firmly into the man's ear. "Beg your Mistress to use her crop slave," he commanded and waited, his hands gently teasing the man's nipples, making them harder, and toying with them.


"P-Please Mistressss," hissed Richard, stammering to breathe and force the words out of his throat. "Use, t-th-the crop on me..." he finished in a whispered rush. He gave a yelp of surprise when the crop fell, not moments after he had finished, landing right on his right nipple. Ereanis let him have another stroke on the other nipple from Rebecca before he put the ring gag on him.


Richard, meanwhile couldn't think, and for the first time in his life felt as though he were going to come without stimulation, and surely would have, had the cock strap not been attached firmly. His skin burnt, and each strike of the crop on his nipples sent darts of pain and pleasure shooting through his head. He moaned and drooled around the new gag, unable to comprehend its use and his situation. Until, that is, Ereanis forced himself into his mouth. Richard had been straight his whole life, but the thought of his situation, that fact that Rebecca was watching him being forced to pleasure another man orally sent him into a delirium of pleasure. His cock pulsed as an orgasm built up behind the strap, making him even more sensitive, painfully so, and that in turn sent another orgasm crashing through him as he realised Rebecca could see how he would already be cumming had it not been for that thick strip of leather.


Rebecca nearly came at the sight of Ereanis entering Richard's mouth, and she let fly with the crop. It fell again and again, thighs, abdomen, armpits, cock, over and over, until the man was a writhing mess, his cock bulging and seemingly on the verge of explosion. He bucked and writhed, twisted and turned, or at least tried to, and moaned around Ereanis as she struck him over and over. Finally, unable to take it anymore, nearly screaming, with pleasure, he gave Rebecca her cue. She didn't waste a moment, not even putting down her crop as she clambered up onto his prone form and slid down his shaft. Richard screamed as he felt his cock enveloped by her. So wet was she, yet so very tight, that she caused him pain, which only added to his pleasure as her pussy swallowed him whole in one fell swoop.


"OOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhh!!" she moaned, helplessly, immediately rising and falling on him, riding him hard into the mattress while Ereanis pulled out of his mouth, removing the gag as he got up. Rebecca barely noticed the act, so absorbed was she in her own pleasure and the feel of Richard so hard and deep inside her, burning and throbbing helplessly in her pussy. She did realise it, however, when Ereanis stepped behind her, grabbing her breasts in his hands and tugging on her nipples. Her frenzy incerease and the pleasure from her nipples ran straight down to her pussy, making her clench and spasm around Richard, tearing helpless yelps and whimpers, moans and semi-screams from the man as she bounced faster and faster on him. It lasted for a few minutes, when suddenly, Erineas reachede down and effortlessly unclipped Richard's cock strap. The result was loud, and had it not been for Ereanis sealing off the sounds with his innate abilities, surely the police would have eventually been called.


Richard screamed, and didn't stop as he came again and again and again, in a seemingly endless cycle, unable to hold back the orgasms that had built up in his cock. His throbbing and monstrous climax sent Rebecca over the edge, nails digging into his skin as she bit into his nipple, hard, screaming around the flesh in her mouth.


Finally, things seemed to settle down, with Rebecca left panting, yet far from sated on the thoroughly used and dried Richard. Richard, panting and gasping for breath, barely noticed Ereanis untie him, and remove his blindfold. He seemed dull around the edges, hazy, in the way that only absolutely fantastic sex can achieve. He couldn't move, yet neither did he want to, and every ache and throb seemed only to twinge the pleasure center in his brain. "MMmmmm..." he moaned softly, cracking his eyes open and curling up on his side as Rebecca got off him.


"You are not finished," purred Ereanis as he grabbed Rebecca's hair and pulled her off Richard and onto the bed, forcing her neck back as he leaned down and kissed her more thoroughly than before. His tongue shoved into her mouth, drawing whimpers from her throat, eagerly swallowed, and shivers coursing down her spine. He bit her lips and growled from deep within his belly at the sounds she made and the feel of her body quivering under his touch. He stopped the kiss to look into the womans eyes, slit with pleasure, her breath coming in short gasps and whimeprs, her entire body limp and quaking. Even though her desire seemed obvious, a quick glance into her thoughts confirmed his beliefs and he dragged her by her hair, Rebecca stumbling and moaning as she tried to stumble and get up in an attempt to keep up with him. That, however, did not work. With a glint in his eye and a slightly extended step, Ereanis ensured that the women fell to her knees and scurried behind him on her hands and knees as he made his way to the wall with the toys on it. Upon reaching there, he let the woman rest for a moment before considering his next course of action.


Rebecca, lost in her world of pleasure, at both the rough treatment and the passion he seemed to so easily raise in her, was oblivious to it all. She hardly registered the fact that she was not moving, let along the fact that she was on her knees her fingers digging into her thighs until her nails begun to draw blood. Finding herself loosing touch with reality as she fell faster and faster into subspace, she didn't even realise that she had not touched herself and was trying very hard not to, since she had not had permission from her Master. This was strange for Rebecca, since she had been a dominant ever since she had first started sexually experimenting and trying out new things. The poor woman hadn't a clue what was going on, and didn't care much. After all, how could she when her pussy seemed to be quite literally dripping with need and her nipples hard enough to throb in pain. Therefore it was only natural that when Ereanis spoke, she seemed shocked as if she had been totally unaware of the room and its occupants.


"Get up," he commanded, and how quickly she obeyed. The mere tone of his voice brought her pussy into pre orgasmic spasms, and she might have even been able to stop herself had she wanted to... until her to bend over and she saw the wooden stock in front of her. Her vision blurred with the strength of the first orgasm, which though small shook her knees and would have dropped her to the ground had it not been for Ereanis' grip on her hair. The pain itself stedied her, though it added to her orgasm ripping a moan, loud and filled with need, from her throat. How she loved the idea of him forcing her into the stock... how it shook her to imagine the ways in which he might use her, bound and exposed, for his own pleasure... the thought of pleasing him forced strength to her legs, giving her enough support to stand. Oh, how she desired to pleasure him.


Ereanis forced himself to blink and sort through the immense strength of her arousal as it hit him, like a frieght train plowing into a picket fence. His smile, next, proved more than anything else the promise of so much to Rebecca she whimpered. Effortlessly he lifted her over it, one hand opening the stock and the other pushing her neck into position, her hands following shortly after. Satisfied that she was in place, he banged the stock down, softly but firmly - the wood resonating from both its solidity and age - startling her, and locked it in place. Next, he took some rope and tied her legs off, straight and wide apart with individual lengths of rope around her ankles. Each leg was secured not only at the ankle, but just under and over her knees and thighs, the remainder of the treated hemp bound in a thick, tight and elaborate knot to hang centimeters under her pussy. Finally, he retrieved the very prominently heavy bull whip hanging on the walls.


Richard might have protested had he been conscious. Fortunately for the two that were awake, he was not.


"Such a wet slut," whispered Ereanis in his husky voice, the sound curling around Rebecca's belly and forcing her to clench and gasp for breath. In demonstration of his point, Ereanis lifted the knot and pressed it against her pussy, slowly grinding it into her and letting the rope absorb some of her moisture. "You like that?" he asked softly as a loud moan escaped her lips and smiled wickedly as he cracked the whip, letting it twist under the woman and purposely missing her breasts by millimetres so that she might feel the movement of air in the whips wake. This drew another half-moan, half-whimper, from the woman, her pussy spasming visibly and dripping her own fluids down her legs. She was so open and ready that Ereanis could see her pink centre open and close spasmodically, showing a dark hole one second, and squeezing out her clear cum the other. The sight turned his eyes into glowing embers.


Rebecca felt as though her breasts weighed considerable more than they had moments ago, as she felt the stir of the air made by the whip. Her mind spun as the thought of the whip assailed her. The knot slightly grinding and firmly pressed against her, being dropped periodically to ensure she wouldn't cum drove her to dizzying new heights of ecstasy. Every time it left her pussy, she was reminded that he could see everything, the cold air hitting her heated, burning and swollen sex to drive that piece of information home with a stunning clarity. "Ooooooooooohhhhhhh..." she moaned helplessly as the whip cracked so very, very close to her clit. The teasing was driving her insane.


"Such a dirty slut," said Ereanis as he raised his arm and curled the whip around her thigh to leave his first mark against her skin. It was gentle, barely a flick, but it would sting profoundly, he knew, as the little less than an inch red mark burned and rose higher from her skin. He savoured her yelp and ensuing moan with relish struck again, marking her other side, but this time aiming and striking the inside of her ass cheek. She screamed softly and heavily at the feel of the burning, though before she had finished the whip had struck again, this time going under her, between her legs and striking just in between her breasts. Her scream resumed its volume when the leather struck her, and didn't stop this time. It turned into a continous scream of pleasure and pain as Ereanis struck again and again, leaving her inner thighs, ass, breasts, sides and back with red marks varying in intensity and length, before stopping.


"Plea... please... please..." she whispered in short stuttering gasps over and over, her mind overloaded with the need to cum, unable to think, unable to function, made helpless by her need to cum.


"Then cum," snarled Ereanis as he leaned his weight forward, hands reasting on the top of the stock, arched over Rebecca and with a flick of his hips sent half of his cock into her pussy. She screamed louder than before, nearly shrieking, her orgasm tearing at the edges of her consciousness, turning her vision to a brilliant white. There was pain and there was pleasure... the pain of the sudden intrusion, his cock forcing his way into her with a strength she could not have imagined... but that paled in contrast to the pleasure of being filled, so very completely filled, and being forced to stretch around his thick girth. So completely did he fill her width that even the juices stopped flowing out of her, leaving her breathless as her scream died, still orgasming around his length. Then, he sent her farther into subspace with yet another twist of his hips that sent the rest of his length into her. His girth easily allowed his cock to rub across her g-spot as he raised one hand and snapped it down in the same instant, sending the tip to strike her clit fast and sharp and her body into overdrive. For Rebecca, breathless and unable to relax enough to draw one either, time seemed to stop as orgasm after orgasm crashed through her.


"Not yet," growled Ereanis and began to mercilessly piston his shaft in and out of her sex, shaking the stock despite its weight and anchoring to the floor, while his hand worked in a blur, sending the whip over her clit each time he pushed into her. Rebecca's eyes had begun to roll back into her head with the sensation of far more pleasure from all the stimulus when she saw Richard.


He had woken at her first scream, and though far to exhausted to ordinarily even sit up, had managed to crawl to her face, still on his hands and knees. Now, he kissed her deeply, cupping her face tenderly in his hands as he did so and sending yet another orgasm shooting through Rebecca so hard her juices spurted out noisily around Ereanis' cock, squirting and wetting him as well as herself.


And Ereanis fed. The lust poured into him and the energy drove his head back, neck arched at the sheer quantity. To his commendable control, he did manage to pour some energy into both Rebecca and Richard. Neither of the two had withstood his feed and the sheer volume of lust and energy in the room in the span of that second, and had passed out after cumming yet again. Richard lay collapsed on his side, his cock still twitching and covered in juices, moist once again, and Rebecca would have been in a predicament had not Ereanis been holding her up. Within moments he had removed her from the stock and bent to lift Richard, gently placing each of them on the bed before wiping their faces and covering them with blankets. Perhaps, he thought silently, it was already too late to avoid getting them involved. However, as he gazed softly at the two lying on the bed, their hands finding each other and curling about themselves even in the unconsciousness he realised he felt no guilt, no fear and only a sense of rightness that he had not felt in far too long. Looking into his eyes as he gently kissed each atop their heads and stroked their hair, one might have seen many things. A lover caring for their own, a parent tending his children, and maybe even a good looking in upon their followers. What anyone and everyone would have seen without exception, would have been love. The tear trailing down his cheek, when Rebecca shifted and reached for his arm, pulling him down towards herself in bed, was not one of sadness. It was a tear of release, of forgiveness. He forgave himself, and he could not have done otherwise, because he knew that he had found love, and home.


Dawn may have broken hours ago, but to Ereanis, even that paled in comparison to his place and the sight before him as he rested, his head above Rebecca's, legs entwined with hers and Richards, one hand under their heads, his palm holding Richards face tenderly upon it and the other draped across Rebecca, his fingers resting lightly on Richard's lower back. The room was silent, save for their breathing and heartbeats.


A new type of dawn had broken...




















THE BURNING BLADE



By Whisper







CHAPTER 3 - DAWNS AND DUSKS





A frown marred his features as Richard looked up into the pair of amber eyes that gazed tenderly at him. He had been woken by his two bunk mates with promises of pleasure, only to find himself bound by his hands, safely secured to the head of the bed. It hadn't taken Rebecca and Ereanis more than a handful of minutes to have Richard fully awake and writhing helplessly on the sheets while they teased his body, kising, licking, stroking and fingering him until he begged to come. Now, his frown was not from lack of pleasure, but rather from the confusion and bewilderment, stemming from the fact that he was hardly conflicted. Richard had always been a straight man. He had thought about other men during his youthful experimentations in life, but had summarily dismissed those fantasies later on as nothing more than just a passing curiosity. Now he had a cock pressed against his, one which was stroking his own in a very arousing way, and had to fight back his orgasm in order to think even remotely clearly. Even more importantly, it didn't feel wrong to him. The thought of two men kissing had never done much in the way of arousing him, but the thought of Ereanis leaning down to kiss him made his body shudder and a moan to roll out from his throat with neither care nor hope to control his reaction.





"If you find yourself taking pleasure in the act, and everyone is feeling the same, do not bother with labels Richard," came the voice of Ereanis as he stopped his actions for a moment, giving Richard some measure of his control and concentration back.





"Richard," came a gentle voice as Rebecca leaned down and to plant a softly chaste, and loving kiss on his lips. "You don't have to do this but don't make that choice for all the wrong reasons. There is care and maybe even a kind of love here, and he's right in saying that you should not feel the need to hold back because of what you feel others might think." Her hand caressed his cheek gently, her soft smile that always seemed to melt his heart playing on her lips. Richard had known that the real reason he had been a bit confused was the fact that straight people weren't supposed to enjoy such acts, and the fact that he was, shook the foundation of his sexuality. Was he really straight? Did it truly matter when Ereanis himself was considered? He hated to admit it, but he was caught in a rather stere-typical male pattern of thought, unconsciously trying to preserve his manhood by trying to find reasons to avoid enjoying himself, albeit in vain. The fact remained that he did not feel strange or odd about doing this with Ereanis and what the other two had said rung true to his own principles that he held much more dear than the perceptions of his sexuality.





"I don't know if I'm bisexual, but you're both right. I'm sorry I'm acting like such a stuck up bloke and ruining the mood." said Richard as softly as he sighed and looked down at his belly, wondering what the hell had gotten into him. He knew Ereanis truly cared for them and harbored nothing less than what could be only described as tenderness towards Rebecca and himself. He felt perfectly horrid for allowing his own misconceptions, confusion and baseless fear to over rule his good judgement.





"There is hardly a reason to apologise,"
 said Ereanis as he shifted to sit on the edge of the bed and smiled over his hsoulder softly at Richard.







"I didn't mean to be so stuck up and am honestly a bit apalled at myself. I know how much you care Ereanis, it is as apparent on your face as your own nose." murmured Richard softly, shifting to rest the right side of his hip against Ereanis, the most he could touch the man in his bound state. Ereanis was right, Richard understood, in saying that there was nothing to apologise. He was not being overly generous, since even Richard knew that things had changed noticeably and it was only natural to doubt and question. Yet, at the same time, the thought of ostracizing someone as a potential lover, who obviously had begun to care so deeply for him so deeply, merely because of his sex made Richard's chest tight with guilt and sadness.





"I think," said Rebecca, smiling and kissing Richard a bit more deeply and lovingly as she reached up to undo the man's bonds, "that now might be the time to stop for brunch. I haven't eaten since last night and am positively famished."





"True," said Richard as his hands came free and sat up slowly, looking at Ereanis, echoing Rebecca's wonderings on whether or not this new addition into their house would need or want food.





"I don't need it, but I haven't eaten in so long that I have begun to wonder what new culinary delights you humans have come up with," came his voice as he chuckled, the sound along bringing smiles to the two who watched him. Silently though, Ereanis made another note, one that would have made him frown had he not quickly hidden it before answering the silent questions Rebecca and Richard had been asking of him. He seemed to have already developed a very close bond with them, and was beginning to both wonder and question, both the cause and implications of this new revelation. It used to take him months and years to be able to read and understand people without reading their minds. Today he found himself able to read the both of them like lovers of old, each minute movement and sound so very easily obvious to the man. What could it mean, he wondered?





"Good, then let's decide on the food," said Richard as his stomach gave a low grumble loud enogh for even Rebecca to hear it.





The ensuing laughter and discussion proved nothing less than heart warming to Ereanis as he watched. Family was a simple enoguh word, with so many possible interpretations that it rarely failed to startle the unwary. Ereanis fell victim easily as he realised he had found a family, even if only a newly budding one, and understood all that this meant to him.





They decided on a chineese meal, since the food in the restraunt was spectacular and the fact that service would be prompt. That being said, they also decided to get the meal home, since neither of the two were sure what people would make of Ereanis and did not want to find out tonight. As they say, too many revelations can put a person in shock, thought Rebecca wryly as she got off the bed and made her way naked to the shower, or was that just herself, then?





Ereanis grinned, couldn't help but, when he got both Richard and Rebecca ready with but a thought. A yelp from the bathroom and the sight of Richard sprining to his feet, gazing at himself were enough to stretch his grin wider still. "I thought it prudent to remind you two that I do have certain abilities and have just fed rather thoroughly." he said as he himself got up and altered his appearance.





Rebecca stepped out of the bathroom with her eyes wide and that only seemed to incerease a the sight of the two men.





Ereanis stood silently to the side, his head cocked to one side and a light hearted, and quite amused, smile playing on his lips. His hair was bound in a tight and intricate braid, the fell over his shoulder and hung to his hips. His eyes seemed a more rich green, and the hair as soft, if not softer, than the most gentle silks in the world with its shimmering brown texture. His skin remained the same, very softly glowing with the runes etched into his hands barely visible on closer inspection. As in the forest, it was not a noticeable light, but merely a richness in the hue of his skin that made it seem as though he glowed. Of course, no much skin was visible except for his hands, face and neck, thanks to his attire. He was dressed in a suit, one that fell down his body rather than worn on it and every line seemed sheer perfection. The coat accented his wide shoulders and slender waist, yet seemed not to take the tiniest bit away from the tightness of his torso that Rebecca knew looked sculpted from the softest, smoothest of woods. The jacket itself was a shade of gray that seemed not to contrast but match the hue of his skin, the radiance of his eyes and smooth fluiditity of his hair. His pants were of the same light gray, and his white shirt and darker tie instantly drew her gaze by its contrast to his throat, which right now Rebecca had an urge to kiss, bite and lick rather than go eat.





She shook her head in awe and turned to look at Richard, hoping to stifle her urges that they might leave the house sooner rather than later, which would not be possible if she gave in right now. How she had erred...





Richard was a sight to behold. The brown coloured jacket seemed a mix between his dark blonde hair, his paler skin and the deep blue eyes... and the effect was stunning. He looked like a caramel custard male dessert, the uses of which were not lost on Rebecca. His eyes were accented by a deeper blue tie, that left his eyes seemingly shimmering and the lighter hue of blue that was his shirt only added to the allure. The jacket and pants seemed to be made of satin, except they didn't shine, and Rebecca knew without needing to touch it that the feel would not be the same. The slickness and gloss would be non existant and instead it would have a slightly more rough texture, more akin to a mix of cotton and satin. Everything would have seemed out of place on anyone else, but on Richard, the darker pants, and tie with the lighter shirt and brown jacket seemed just perfect.





She turned to the side at a nod from Ereanis, convinced by the gaping mouth of Richard, and gasped at the sight of herself in the mirror. Her blond hair fell around her face in long thick curls, leaving her amber eyes glowing. Her skin seemed paler than usual in contrast with the deep red dress that sat so easily on her, matching her lips and fingernails in colour but halfway between in hue, being darker than the light red on her nails and lighter than her lips, but by oh so little. The dress fell from her neck, where it was held by a knot that left the long red streaks of cloth entwined in her hair, peeking out and hiding with every movement of her strawberry blonde mane. Her back was left bare, as were her shoulders and arms, the dress covering her front only to wrap around her a slight way above the lowest point of her back, so that when she sat, nothing embaressing would show. From there the dress fell loosely to her knees leaving her calves bare except for the straps of her heels that ran up her ankles to be bound just between the bottom of her calves and the tops of her ankles, leaving her comfortably secure in them. She looked up and gaped at Ereanis, speechless at the job he had done.





The sound of a chuckle dragged Richard's gaze from Rebecca to Ereanis. "One last thing," he said softly, smiled and bowed deeply, his braid falling forward. But it had barely touched the ground before it was flicked up, arching over Ereanis shoulder to fall at his back. Within the span of that moment there had been four additions made to Rebecca's and Richard's attires. Rebecca now wore ruby earings and the straps of her shoes had lengthened, curling up her legs in graceful circles to end at the juncture between her thighs. The straps were of soft and smooth leather, and rubbed across her legs as she moved, but stopped jut short of her pussy, resting instead, so very close that each movement seemed a self imposed tease. It also brought her attention to the fact that she had no panties on. Richard now wore a pair of wrist cuffs that were tastefully designed from something that seemed to be leather but was much rougher and fitted tightly around his wrists. They would be easly disguised as bracelets to those that chose not to acknowledge what they were. The last addition was made out of sight, but no less attention grasping for Richard. He wore a collar, of ancient leather and metal that lay nestled against the bottom of his throat, hidden behind the collar and tie. "Now let us go out and dine," murmured Ereanis softly as he walked forward to raise both his hands in either direction, one towards Richard and one towards Rebecca.





Richard was not very startled since he knew that they would hardly be picking up food, dressed as they were, but still held his doubts as to just how people might react to Ereanis and what questions might be directed his way. He kept his doubts to himself, realising that Ereanis would be very capable when it came to handling people, and kept faith that this night that was quickly approaching would be nothing short of specacular.





Each took a hand and the three shared a silent moment of contentment before heading for the door.





They reached Maddame Chi's safely and uneventfully, with Richard driving and Rebecca sitting behind him, occasionally reaching around to tease the man while Ereanis sat quietly and watched peacefully. The inevitable result came in the form of an erection that Richard could not hide and after finding parking, Ereanis offered a long, smooth and very red solution, the same red of Rebecca's dress.





"Richard," he said as they stepped out
 of the car
, producing a red silk ribbon that had somehow appeared in the his hands, "do not move, and Rebecca, if you would be so kind as to reveal the cause of the man's agitation?"





Rebecca was startled and had not expected the glint in Ereanis' eye. She did not hesitate however, and after glancing around to ensure they were out of sight behind the cars and no one was on the street, gladly stepped in front of Richard to unbuckle his belt and drop Richard's pants, followed shortly by the boxers and underwear. Ereanis stepped forward with a smile as Rebecca turned towards him and took Richard's cock in his palm. First, he wrapped a length of silk gently around Richard's cock, just under the head, and then began to tighten it as he wound the rest around his shaft, moving lower and lower, the tightness increasing with each turn, until he reached the base. A rather mischeivous smile played on his lips as he leaned forward and wrapped the last length around his balls. Finally, he tied off the silk tightly, tightening it further and getting up. "Now slave, pull up your pants," he commanded Richard as a wide eyed, lust filled Rebecca watched.





Richard was already throbbing in his soft and silky prison, unable to get hard, held by the constricting bonds. His head swam for a moment as he bent over and saw just how well the silk would hold him, forcing him to be soft, but each spurt of arousal would not be fade as easily as it ordinarily might. The bonds served two purposes, he realised then, first, to keep him from getting hard, and second, to make sure each teasing touch would torment him for a little longer than it normally would. His heart pounded in his chest and his cock twitched involuntarily as it tried to find release. Pants up and buckled, they finally made their way into the restaurant, Rebecca holding onto Ereanis' arm and Richard following on Ereanis other side, very slightly behind, unable to make himself walk beside the two. He understood well that he was their slave, and despite love, affection and care, when it came to certain situations, he was meant to act like one. This, he thought to himself, definetely classified as one of those circumstances.





Maddame Chi's was a very high class restaurant in the city. It was new, having started its trade only a few months ago, and was known to offer privacy, good meals, cozy atmosphere's and very expensive and good service. This was due in no small part to the sheer volume of investments. It was fairly difficult to get a table without a reservations, but somehow neither Rebecca nor Richard were surprised when they were offered one immediately when Ereanis asked if they could find a table to dine at, that evening. The layout was a very interesting feature of the restaurant that appealed to people by and large. Upon entrance, one arrived at the kiosk and would be led inside once a reservation had been confirmed and would be asked to wait in the 'entertainment area'. This area was actually a vast room that had been modelled after its name sakes designed and still used in Japanese and some Chinese palaces and mansions. It was a chamber that had a depressed cetral area, much like an arena though more shallow, and comfortale seating all around. The center of the chamber was where performers did their shows, be it fire breathing, juggling, tarot card reading or even a few flying frying feats by some of the su-chef's. There were four doors at each of the four corners of the room, all leading to the dining area, that circled the entire room and which in turn was circled by a very large aquarium housing several marine animals from large rays to tiny shrimps and everything in between. A bar took up one side of the entertainment hall and extended into the dining area as well, different teams working on differrent side of the bar. The dining area itself was a marvel in design. Each table could seat up to twenty people when extended, and was enclosed by double sets of straw screens, adding a sense of privacy in what would otherwise be a large and open, vulnerably obvious seeming setting. Each table, and that table's chairs, was made from a different wood and different design, all hand picked to offer visually stimulating and comfortable seats. The service was nothing short of spectacular, with each table having at least one maitre'd, a minimum of two waiters and a maxmium of six. Of course, the prices corresponded with the scene and everything was rather expensive. Fortunately, when Rebecca had voiced her doubts in the car, Ereanis had merely smiled and told them that neither of the two would be paying. They did not understand what this meant, but wisely kept their doubts silent.





"I shall allow the both of you to order since I have little knowledge of the cuisine," said Ereanis, once they had settled in and the maitre'd had left them with the menu's and recommendations. Richard and Rebecca were only too glad to oblige given how hungry they were, and despite the large number of choices, they placed their orders fairly quickly. It wasn't long before they each nursed a glass of their liqour and began to talk about what lay next for them in their future.





"Well," said Ereanis after taking a sip of his wine and sitting back, "there are a lot of things to be done and just enough time to do it all in. I will show you these creatures soon, and then perhaps you will both have a clear idea of just what we are dealing with. In the meantime, I think it prudent that we better prepare ourselves." Ereanis stopped then, quickly noting their reactions and deciding how best to proceed. "Forget about money, because it is merely another material necessity and can be easily obtained."





"Maybe not," said Rebecca, frowning at the thought of just 'creating' money. She doubted the influx would be very noticeable or harmful to anyone or the economy iself, but did not think it wise despite that. After all couterfeiting was a practice that had a colourful history, littered with criminals who were sitting in prison cells sporting only two colours, those being black and white. Though, she finished the thought wryly looking at Ereanis, he probably would look perfectly colourful in prison drab.





Ereanis chuckled as he followed her thoughts. "I have already arranged for the money," he replied to her thoughts, "The next time you visit the bank you will find a bit more clarity on the subject." Ereanis raised a hand and smiled, silencing the two before they could protest and moving on. "Instead there are other things that need to be done. We will need a larger home and some other things that though important, will prove useless in the end unless we solve a larger problem."





Richard and Rebecca leaned forward as Ereanis sighed and took another sip of his wine.





"I will not pull the both of you into this war-" Ereanis began and was summarily silenced by Richard.





"What is the cost of failure?" he asked in a loud growl that cut off Ereanis voice as surely as a tap that had just been turned off. If a few drops of argument began to drip out, they stopped by the vicious jerk that Rebecca gave.





"You may be inhuman Ereanis but everyone can fail. Answer his question," she said in a cold tone looking at Ereanis in the eyes and not blinking.





"Too great..." murmured Ereanis as he glanced back and forth between the two and sighed before looking down. It was too great, indeed, he thought to himself, and the following mental image he sent to verify his point turned Richards face pale and caused Rebecca to growl and shake her head before taking a deep breath.





"Then ignore your stupidity of keeping us out," growled Richard after a few breaths.





"Agreed," continued Rebecca softly, "you cannot expect us to sit on the sidelines and watch. What would you do if we had changed places?" asked Rebecca softly and sat back watching Ereanis.





He was surprised, but not too much. He had long ago expected this and knew they would only be more insistent after he had shown them what lurked under the ground. Most people might not have been so, but they would be. He sat silently and marvelled at the two people glaring at him across the table. Unable to stop himself he chuckled and bowed his head in agreement. "As you will," he murmured as a sea of waiters wandered into the enclosure and inevitably ended the conversation for the three.





Ereanis' eyebrows raised ever so slightly at the sight of the food and rose further, impercetibly to most, but not Rebecca and Richard, as he felt a telltale twinge in his head. He turned and looked through the faces until his eyes met her. Rebecca and Richard, sensing his intrigue turned to follow Ereanis' line of sight.





He gazed at the woman as she smiled and handed a drink to a waiter from behind the bar. Ereanis didn't understand why he felt the mental tug. He frowned, and though he hated it, followed her thoughts back to her and in a moment, understood all too clearly. The chuckle told anyone who knew what had happened, that the intrusion had been worth it. He didn't like poking into the minds of others, since it seemed to him a way of cheating, a shortcut he was loath to take. It was always better to understand the person and get to know them, over time being able to read them just as old friends or lovers could read each other. This time, however, he realised that no amount of talking could have helped him. She was afire with need, the source of which was evident to him as a glowing ball of lust poured forth from her mind. This, he thought, would be a perfect time to show Rebecca and Richard a few other abilities.





"Watch," came the silent thought to both Rebecca and Richard. The voice was Ereanis' own, but echoed and was more substnatial as it ran through their minds. "Time is not a creation of human beliefs, but a scientifically proven result of certain actions. Thus, I cannot stop it since my control does not extend to the very worlds themselves. However," he went on in his communication to the bewildered couple in front of him, "since everything and every being on this world is of this world in one way or another, the Earth itself has a very high level of control over most of it. Certain perversions, less so, but as a rule, all things natural are at the every beck and call of Mother Nature, and her influence stretches farther than most would realise. She is a restful and quiet, secluded entity now, largely because so few have heeded her call in the past centuries. Now however, she will listen to mine." Having completed his mysterious explanation, Ereanis closed his eyes, and flexed his thoughts, pushed his requests outwards and communicated his desire. The world once again seemed to hold it breath for a few moments and this time Rebecca and Richard felt it more clearly. Time halted, people froze, or rather slowed down incredibly, and certain changes were made. They were imperceptible, no matter how sharp a person, but to those who had been allowed a glimpse into fate, it was fairly obvious. The exact changes themselves weren't often seen, but all three could now tell something very significant had changed and this night would end differently than had been expected. The mere fact that Rebecca and Richard had been included in the forging of this new timeline, only added to the significance and made Ereanis smile. He waited until the waiters had left before explaining further, aloud this time.





"It seems you have met approval at the hands of a true power," he chuckled softly at their confused and astounded looks. "The Earth itself has allowed you take part in a forging, one that though minor, is rare to experience and you have felt as I have felt the course of possibilities and probabilities shift. It means," he went on, noticing their continuing confusion, "that you will be able to hear the call of nature and even communicate, when there is a genuine need. A true gift." he finished, satisfied at the comprehension dawning on their faces.





"But... What... How..." stammered Rebecca as Richard's face went from confusion to unbridled awe, an ironically similar look to the amused Ereanis.





"Do not, as you humans are so fond of saying, look a gift horse in the mouth," he said laughing softly and instead proceeded to taste and sample a bit of everything on his plate, his eyes shining, not unlike those of young children who have just seen their letter to Santa Clause answered and find all they wanted under the christmas tree on the special day.





"What's going to happen?" asked Rebecca softly, taking her cue from Ereanis and pouncing on her beef with abandon, remembering just how hungry she was.





"It is yet to be revealed to us," said Ereanis with a shrug as he continued to eat. What he said was true, he knew, for things were never revealed openly. That knowledge was a ricky thing and could often change the course of actions altogether. No, he thought silently, things would be revealed, and opportunities presented to them. Whether those were taken or not, remained up to the trio. All they could do was be watchful and patient. Faith, he thought with a content sigh, was often a very common aspect of dealing with this world.





"So," broke in Richard a few minutes later after they'd all had time to digest, as much as possible, the surprising, albeit pleasant turn of events. "I understand that this purging," he went on, raising an eyebrow in question, wondering if the word was appropriate, "might be an elongated process. But what are our battle plans for now?" he asked. It wasn't that Richard was all too eager to move, but rather given the circumstances, and his experience in the military, he knew that once a goal had been set, sitting around and waiting for something to happen was often a lethal mistake. More than the loss of a tactical advantage in the form of a first strike, it was the drop in morale, boderline boredom, nerves and the idea of inaction that seemed to pose a larger pitfall. Though, he himself had no idea what to do, since he had no idea what they were dealing with in this case.





"I suppose we may relax tonight," said Ereanis, having already a relatively clear picture of how things should be progressing and well aware of Richard's concerns, "and can start tomorrow. Both of you should probably leave your jobs, or at the very least take some leave soon, since things will be moving along swiftly. I will show you what exactly we are dealing with tomorrow night. After that we will need a new home to act as our base. I confess that I am not sure how many others will inevitably get involved, since I hardly expected anyone to be so. Though now, I imagine there will be some allies. Go to your work tomorrow, and I shall have something more concrete when you return." he finished to nods from Richard and Rebecca. The truth was, he had already a clear idea of how things were about to be structured. People would join the fight, slowly and surely, and some would be sharing their new home.





Past times had been different, Ereanis thought silently as he reminisced. Sometimes 'his' people were chosen from birth, other times recruited. Always the process had taken exertion from Ereanis, exertion of his will and desires and then those strong enough, smart enough, brave enough would be chosen and in one way or another called to him. This time, it would take no effort from Ereanis, and instead situations simply present themselves to him for him to judge best. Perhaps it was Mother Nature's need that would create such instances. However, Ereanis thought it had more to do with the new world. True that in this day and age a lot had changed, and not a majority for the better. The changes did seem stark. Pollution was rife, greed and hunger for everything from drinkable water and edible foods, to money, power and glory had magnified beyond his expectations or imaginations. This naturally created its discord within him, but he found hope within the gray fog that seemed to have envelope this world. Because there were so many more people, there were so many more people who were passionate, who loved, hated, laughed and wept. Bravery was now more common as well as a host of other traits a person would need in order for the desire to help Ereanis at his task to manifest. One would not be able to help in that same way as another, and rarely ever had in Ereanis knowledge of the past, but everyone who found warmth and comfort in the trio's company, would help and risk everything, to save their loved ones.





"You're not thinking to be doing nothing silly without us, now are you?" came Rebecca's voice, startling Ereanis from his thoughts. Looking down, he smiled at the fork of vegetables hovering close to his mouth, and realised he had forgotten to eat. Chuckling and shaking his head, he finished the forful.





"No. I was merely reminding myself how very easily people band together when calamity approaches, never swiftly enough to ruin this world." he said cryptically. "On to other pleasurable topics," he smiled as he pushed back his chair and rose gracefully from the table, "Why don't you accompany me to men's room Richard?"





Richard, eyes wide glanced at Rebecca, who merely smiled a bit broader, a tad bit wickedly, and patted his thigh lingeringly, before nodding and getting up mumbling, "Sure..."





Ereanis pushed a screen aside and smiled at Richard as he brushed past, and followed him out, closing the screen behind him. The restroom's were not very far and instead of the ordinary stalls, were in fact well ventilated and roomy, well rooms. They were also unisex. There were five such rooms, accessible through doors from the inside of what seemed to be a large plush living room, where someone could wait for their turn should it be a busy night and all the rooms full. The lavatory's themselves were rather large, each one being circular, with a diameter of a little under twelve feet. Each had a large sink, two large floor to ceiling mirrors on opposite sides of the wall, and a commode. Everything was tastefully done in subtly veined marble and smooth silver fixtures. The two men entered the sitting area and Ereanis smiled as they past a man who was leaving. The stranger smiled back and continued on his way back to his table. Richard was a bit perturbed and nervous himself to smile at anyone. His surprise incereased when Ereanis gripped his upper arm and stopped him dead in his tracks, and spoke clearly in a soft voice, "Slaves crawl, Richard. Crawl behind their owners." Richard could hardly stop the heavy gasp that left his chest and only dropped to his knees, finding no other reponse that seemed apt.





Ereanis himself smiled inwardly. The opportunity had already arrived, and he had made sure his voice was just loud enough to be heard. Silently chuckling at the state the man was about to be in, he walked towards the door on his right, opened it and stepped back to watch the slave crawl through. Once Richard was in, he closed the door sharply, not bothering to lock it, a fact that made Richard bite his lips and look down, something that Ereanis saw and knew signalled the man's helpless state of arousal.





"Get up," commanded Ereanis.





Richard stood slowly, his knees weak and goosebumps breaking out all over his body. His cock throbbed and twitched uncontrollably, still bound in the silk, and Ereanis felt only lust pour forth from Richard and knew that the inability of his cock to become erect was a turn on, on so many levels to the man. The domination implied, the forcefulness of the bonds, the humiliation of being tied to remain soft, the pain of the throbbing... all were quickly turning Richard into a helpless little slave. Ereanis relished it all as he stepped closer to the man and circled him, stopping behind the shivering man after one complete circle and then some to whisper, "Strip."





Richard could do naught but comply, a heat filled moan escaping his lips as he took off his jacket, loosened his tie and unbottoned the shirt.





"Sit on the floor and take of the rest," Said Ereanis, and again a moan escaped Richard's lips. Once he was completely nude, except for the red silk that stood out wonderfully and obviously, not unlike the bow on a gift wrapped present, Ereanis issued his next command. "Close your eyes." he said, and shortly after obeying, Richard felt a thick cloth bound over his eyes. "Hands behind your head
, legs together and stay like that." ordered Ereanis as he stepped towards the door.





Richard couldn't see, but he heard the door open and then close. Heart racing, head spinning, he moaned softly, not wanting to disobey Ereanis but wondering how it would look to someone who walked in. The doors couldn't be locked from the outside and he knew it. His arousal soared, and it took more effort than he had imagined to keep his trembling legs under him. His cock twitched uncontrollably and his mouth stayed open, small gasps of breath escaping his lips as he shivered, wondering when Ereanis would come back.





"I have left a present for you to indulge in," said Ereanis as he walked into their enclosure again. Normally, Ereanis might have had to worry about someone stepping in on Richard. Fortunately he was not normal and had actually used a bit of magic to ensure that anyone who tried to open the door would find it locked, in a way that no key could open. He smiled as Rebecca frowned at him, and told her which bathroom it was, and sat back smiling. "I will join you two shortly," he said in a voice that promised so much without the words ever have been spoken.





Rebecca got up on shaky legs and marvelled at the turn of events as she left for the washroom. Two days ago, she had finally worked up the courage to do something with Richard. It had merely been a testing of the waters, and now she was heading to a restroom to use her 'slave'. She had no illusions and knew that when it came to things honesty, honour and such other commendable traits, there were many people more deserving of her fortunes despite all her hard times and good intentions. Not that she wasn't particularly good and didn't deserve them, but rather that she was surprised and saw so many others who would be more deserving. She shrugged as she reached the door and taking a deep breath, opened it. Perhaps you are inhibited by your own perceptions and self, came a thought from Ereanis and she found herself sighing as she stepped in. Perhaps he was right. Maybe it was merely a perceptional bias, one that any person might have. Rebecca, however stopped caring the minute she closed the door and turned around. Richard was shaking, shivering where he stood, his breathing hoarse and cock twitching in its bonds.





He heard the door open and his heart went into overdrive. The thought that he had been caught, lodged itself into his mind and he fought desperately to try and hide his arousal and yet stay still, making no move to remove the blindfold. It was then that he realised that this might indeed be a test. Ereanis would need no such thing, nor for that matter would Rebecca. It was a test of himself and for himself, to see if he could trust and rely on his new found lovers. In a relationship that relied so very highly on trust and faith, Richard knew in the instant after the door closed, that he could do naught but trust the two new and dear people in his life. So he stood, fighting for control, now against desire and need that tore through his body.





She couldn't believe how much the sight of him affected her, and how quickly... she had not been thinking of sex, but was suddenly dripping with need, and knew that the top straps near her pussy were already busy absorbing her seeping fluids. Shaking her head, and stepping forward, her eyes watched the central line of his body for any telltale movement, and caught everything, the sharp intake of breath at the sound of her heels, the twitch of his cock and bottom when she stepped close enough for him to smell her perfume, the clench of his stomach when she let one nail drag across a nipple, and relished it all.





Richard knew that whoever was in front of him, was female, and initially he thought of Rebecca. This immediately changed as his next thought drove a point home. It could be anyone and he would not know. A moan escaped his lips and logic left his mind at the thought. He could no longer think and hence could not tell it was Rebecca. Until, her voice spoke into his ear.



"Such a horny little slave." she said. Rebecca nearly purred at his reactions to her and the moan that escape his lips. She stood at his back and slid one nail between his legs, sliding the digit across that smooth, soft skin between his thighs. His body was covered in goosebumps and she knew he was in pain from the constant twitching of his cock. Her smile took on a darker light as her other hand went around his chest and her nails dug into one nipple, pinching and twisting it hard enough to sting but still feel good to the highly aroused Richard. The responding moan, louder this time, brought a chuckle from her lips. "Well, let's see you earn a reward or punishment my horny little cum making slave." she purred, punctuating each word word with a little firmer and firmer squeeze on his nipples and balls, that left Richard gasping and moaning uncontrollably for her.





*****





Ereanis felt her walk towards their enclosure. He could nearly taste her, so strong was her lust. Thus, he wasn't surprised when she stepped in and bent over the his lap, purposely trying to entice him as she took his empty wine glass. He was even slightly amused when, disappointed at his lack of an overt reaction, turned in the same position to give him an unhibited view of her tight bottom as she reached across the table to take Rebecca's and Richard's abandoned drinks as well. 





"Would you like a second, Sir?" she asked softly, standing up beside him and turning her face to his, her voice breathy as she felt her desire soar at the sight of his smile. It was easily the most stunning smile she had seen and her already moist panties turned quickly into a sopping mess. Eyes the colour of a mist enshrouded field of the greenest grass captured her gaze as effortlessly as his hands could hold her in place. Suddenly she was aware of the most minute sensations, her heart thudding in her chest, the feel of the dress across her thighs, her bra under her top, the tickle of a stray strand of hair at the base of her neck and so much more. Yet, she was oblivious to sounds outside of thee enclosure, the thought of being surrounded by so many people, so close, did not even enter her mind.





Ereanis gazed at her, drinking in her appearance. She was rather beautiful. A poster girl for British breeding, her hair hung in a long very light blonde, nearly whitish, braid that fell nearly as low as Erenis'. Her eyes sparkled in a light blue hue and matched her hair and fair complexion easily. She was well built, being far from skinny or fat, but with just enough meat on her bones to accent each curve and arch of her body. Her lips were a pale pink, and the slight lipstick she had applied did not change their colour or tone, but merely ensured they were a bit more visible. They seemed moist, given her state and glistened a bit. The rest of her was fairly similarly fabulous, right down to her manicured and pedicured toe nails, Ereanis knew without seeing.





"A name would be much appreciated. Mine is Ereanis," he said, not moving, not breaking the gaze and content to watch the woman's arousal steadily and rapidly incerease.





"Chelsea," she breathed, fighting back the urge to moan. 'What on Earth was going on?' she wondered silently to herself as the first of her juices began to slide down her thighs. She had been aroused all day, but this was hardly even close to that. Chelsea had spent most of the morning at home, teasing herself to the brink of orgasm, stopping just short and forcing herself down, initially with some harsh nipple play, spanking and pussy slapping. Soon, however these proved to be very large turn ons as her pain and pleasure centers got jumbled. It had been a task she had been commanded to do by one of her friends from her classes at the local university. She had seen Ereanis and Richard wander into the restrooms and then Rebecca follow shortly after Ereanis returned. Fairly sure that it could be a harmless coincidence, and well aware of both the possibilities and likelihood of it, felt more certain that there was something else going on. Had she known that her emotions had been brought more clearly and distinctly to the surface, her arousal now soaring, due to the innate effect of being close to Ereanis, she might have realised just how right she was in her thinking and would have guessed the outcome of this night fairly easily. She did not however and so merely stood in a pool of her lust, her juices now visible and glistening as the made their way down to her knees, her skin burning with heat, nipples hard and heart pounding. 





Ereanis, dipping into her thoughts, saw quickly both the possibilities of disaster in that relationship and the realization as well as inability for Chelsea to refuse her friend. In the span of a second he knew that her submission to him would be a healthy experience and help her to gain a better perspective on herself and her desires. So it was with a clear conscience that Ereanis pushed his chair a bit farther back from the table, raised a hand to the trembling woman and said, "A lovely name. To answer your question, no, I wouldn't like a second. Why would I, when there is a first so obviously ready and wanting before me?"





Chelsea's knees nearly buckled. His voice had been sweet ennough to cause her to melt, but his tone this time stirred her submissive side and brought it screaming to the surface. She would have cum with only a word, so aroused was she. Instead, unable to speak and thoroughly flustered, the desire to 'serve' Ereanis bringing moans to her throat that she had to fight back, she stepped forward and took his hands. Whispered words of "Yes Sir," left her lips and she found herself, unsurprisingly going to her knees before the man, guided by his hand. She needed no urging or directions and was fumbling at his pants within moments, pulling out his cock, just as one last coherent thought sent all logic and reason from her mind.





The thought that she was on her knees before a man, sucking his cock, and anyone from the owner to a fellow waiter might walk in. The response the thought evoked would have been louder had she not fallen on the large thick shaft that stood up from the strangers pants, and instead only a muffled moan escaped and a second when Ereanis grabbed her hands and held them together in his own, forcing her to use only her head to help her in her task.





*****





Richard couldn't breathe. His heart pounded as he tried, helplessly and involuntarily, to moan, but no sound escaped from his lips. Instead his body only jerked, each muscle pulling taught in helpless involuntarily spasms as a pleasure and pain ruppled through him in great crashing waves.





Rebecca had long ago taken off his blindfold. In fact it was one of her first actions, preceeded by a kiss. She had smirked at the man before moving to turn him and stand behind him, while he then faced the mirror. A few kisses and touches later. "Watch you slutty slave, watch your own cock twitch with lust," her commanded in soft, taunting tones. He could not disobey and watched as she wrapped her hands around, showing him how each touch to different parts of his body, affected him differently. The first has been a wet kiss just under his jaw, againt his neck. She had purred at his moan, and proceeded then to use her hands, pushing one finger into his mouth and then a second, moving them in and out whispering, "Why don't you suck them, slave boy? Go on, you know you want to suck them. After all, you're so good at sucking cock," she had finished, the last line sending waves of lust through him. His cheeks developed a rosy blush, and his cock throbbed and twitched. However, his desperate desires for relief and humiliation forced a moan out from deep in his throat and he found his eyes closed. In that instant, Rebecca's other hand flashed out behind her and landed loudly and firmly on his ass. He had actually not enjoyed the sensation of burning spreading quickly over his right cheek, since she had hit him with all she had, and Rebecca's visits to the gym had ensured she had her fair share.





"Slut!" she had demanded, letting him go and stepping back. "I did not tell you to stop. Bend over the sink," she ordered with a wicked glint in her eye and stood beide it, ensuring that his legs were spread with a kick of her foot, placing his hands against the wall and forcing his head down. "Count," she said, just when her hand flew down at the other, unsmacked, cheek. The slap was loud and echoed around the chamber, resonating, as Richard yelped and said shakily, "One." Fire crept down his legs and up his stomach, the sting flaring and the flaring again once the next blow had fallen, back on his still stinging right cheek. This time the throb lasted and did not diminish, not even when the fourth landed, and only added to his torment. True to her word, she had completed the twenty.





Rebecca was rather certain that she had exerted herself in the spanking as she gently stroked Richard's bottom, but she was equally sure he could take it. Never had twenty strikes hit more accurately on the identical two spots, and never had she thought just twenty would be enough to leave someone's bottom severely damaged. Though she was sure from the angry glow of Richard's skin, her twenty had been an effective punishment and he was not very happy by the actual sensations. She turned on the taps near Richard's head, startling him and jerking his head up, so lost was he in lust and pain, sinking so quickly back into sub space. She understood why, and hoped Ereanis would join them soon. She did not, she realised, have much alone time with Richard, and despite being comfortable in sharing him with Ereanis wanted some. It was clear though that Ereanis with his innate abilities would complete the lust she planned to ignite in the man tonight. If she should give him her orgasm now, a necessity considering the state of his penis, she would hardly have had a satisfactory session. "That's a good slave," she cooed as she ran warm hands over his ass, gently rubbing and stroking them, blowing cool air upon them, all the while noting the content smile of a slave with knowledge of his mistake, having been disciplined, and understanding that his ownership was real and not some temporary fancy.





"Thank you for disciplining your slave Mistress, and he is very sorry to have disappointed you," said Richard, truly meaning the words.





"Good boy," she murmured softly when she was finished. "I suppose I shouldn't let you cum since you misbehaved," she said in an off-handed manner that tightened Richard's gut visibly, much to Rbecca's delight. "But, you've taken your punishment well, so I think 'some' sort of reward is due. Stand up pet," came her next command, immediately obeyed, and with a hand around his wrapped dick, she led him to the mirrors yet again. This time though, she pushed him to his knees, and pulled her dress up. "Do you like your Mistress' pussy?" the question accentd by a heeled foot resting on his shoulder, her fingers pulling aide her labia to reveal the source of moisture trailing down her thighs.





"Yes Mistress," came Richard's breath and hoarse reply.





"Do you want to kiss and lick it slave?" she asked coyly, a finger now running a soft circle around her opening, her eyes misting over with lust at the sound of Richards desperate moan. The digit circled slowly, enticing throbs that sent more fluids trailing down her thighs, her clit now visible, poking out from it sheath to quiver and throb in Richard's face.





Richard felt his body burn, everything from his fingers to toes aglow with heat, at the sight before him. The smell reached his nose distinctly, the musty aroma, tinged with a natural sweetness and the headiness of her perfume was leaving his throat dry and forcing gasps and moans from him. How he loved this feeling, he thought to himself. The knowledge that she was teasing him, taunting him by rubbing herself, pushing herself so agonisingly slowly towards a climax, without letting him touch, let alone kiss her, drove logic from his head in a wave of desire.





"OOOoooo... does the slave want a lick?" she purred as she held up one finger, coated in a sheen of her fluids, above his head. A push of her leg sent Richard onto his back, her dressing falling down as she stood once again on two feet, and walked around him. She smiled as she circled him, watching his dilated pupils following her digit. Finally, lowering herself in a crouch, she gently got on her knees and began a slow seductive sway up from his feet. "Or perhaps the slave would like something else," she purred, her breath playing over his thighs as her smile turned more seductive and her finger began to rub the tip of his cock.





Richard moaned, long and loud, knowing that his cum was building from the telltale sparks of pleasure that shot through his head. He couldn't think anymore, the capability having long been lost to him, and was in subspace.





Rebecca slid her moist finger lower and eased into Richard's clutching tunnel, feeling his muscles clutching at him, desperately clenching and tightening around her finger, his need to cum overpowering the helpless man. Of course, he would have an orgasm, though perhaps he might not be cumming anytime soon, thought Rebecca with a silent and wicked chuckle, her finger gently beginning to move in and out of him. Any stranger might have thought that Richard was in the throes of a mind blowing orgasm even then, but Rebecca knew him a bit better and was well aware that he was not quite there yet. She smiled as she turned around and slid her dress up with one hand until her pussy was accessible. Then, carefully, she lowered herself onto Richard, ensuring that her pussy pressed his burning cock into his stomach, and began to grind herself gently on it.





"OOOOOHHHHH!!!" came Richard's helpless moan as he twitched and writhed under her, his own actions only arousing her more. The result was fairly obvious since her pussy began to leak more fluids onto his cock and the finger in his ass, now turned into two, thrusting a bit harder. He couldn't think much, though, and found himself speechless, breathless, unable to think and at her complete mercy.





Rebecca felt the first orgasm building in her slave and began to slide herself across his still limp, albeit aroused, cock. Her clit rubbing the silk bonds sent sparks of pleasure up her spine and the feeling of the helpless man's jerks under her only added to the pleasure. She felt the first moan of pleasure building in her throat and stopped, knowing that if she pushed much farther, she could expect some serious damage to Richard. He might still enjoy it since the pleasure nearly over rode the pain, but she did not want to have him hurt too seriously and decided on caution as she stood.





"Get up, slave!" she commanded as she stood and walked over to the mirror, adjusting her dress and making sure she looked acceptable.





Richard forced his concentration back to normal, gasping with the effort and groaning, trying to assemble some train of thought. It helped that all touching had stopped and Rebecca's voice was jut loud enogh and firm enough to cut through his lust filled daze. Of course, with that came the throbbing and burning in his cock from the desperate need for release, but he stood, on shaky legs, heaving for breath and eyes still glazed.





Then Ereanis walked in, silently but with a noticeable effect.





Ereanis smiled as he entered. He had debated bringing the woman along, and had sifted through a few of her thoughts to ascertain that she would be neither offended nor frightened by the state he could feel Richard in. Finding no such likely objections, he had been more than glad to bring her along. Of course, he would give Rebecca and Richard a bit of time of their own, and so found himself content to resume watching Chelsea suck hungrily on his member. Unfortunately for the poor woman, she did not know the perfect control Ereanis had over his own orgasms and found herself desperately wet and hungry for his cum, that refused to come out. Ereanis followed her desires easily enough and quickly seeing where her thoughts were leading her, insecurity central, lifted her chin with his free hand and thoroughly kissed her. She had been startled, true, but all thoughts flew from her mind and when she found herself pulled up and easily carried to an empty chair, offered no protests, only making helpless whimpers and moans into Ereanis' mouth, ones that he hungrily ate up.





And so she found herself gagged with a napkin as orgasm after orgasm crashed through her minutes later, Ereanis mouth fastened to her mons and fingers buried deep inside her, twisting and stroking her to climax after climax. So skilled was he, that had he not been ready to swallow her cum, she would have had a problem explaining the spill of water on the floor. Of course, the spill of water was hardly that, and instead was the first time someone had made her squirt, let alone so soon and so hard.





Ereanis had absorbed much of her lusts, but he could tell the poor woman would take a minute to come down from orbit, enough for his next actions and spent the last minute or so stroking and cooing to her, feeling content to sit there without doing anything else. Once she was presentable again, he asked her to show him to the washrooms, and despite, or because of that mischeivous glint in his eyes, Chelsea had agreed. Now as she stepped in behind Ereanis, she began to wonder just what these people were.





Rebecca smiled at Ereanis' appearance, with warmth and curiousity both, as she noticed he had brought his guest. Chelsea was standing, barely, beside Ereanis, her breath hot and heavy, trying and failing to overcome the powerful waves of lust at the sight of Rebecca casually turning from the mirror to smile at her, while Richard stood, naked except for his bonds.





"This is Chelsea. Chelsea, I'd like for you to meet Rebecca and Richard." said Ereanis with a smile.





"It's a pleasure to meet you, Chelsea," said Rebecca, stepping forward to look closer at the blue eyes woman and smiling rather more warmly.





"Richard is a bit tied up, pre-occupied if you will," murmured Ereanis as he strode towards the man. It was plain to see that Richard was still fighting to control his breathing and words would be impossible for the moment. But the sound of his name coming from Ereanis lips brought a measure of calm upon the man. Not a lot, but enough for him to realise there was someone knew in the room and that he should probalby greet them. He had neither the time nor the ability, for Ereanis was now standing in front of him. A hand flashed out and grabbed his hair, twisting him around, forcing Richard from his feet as another hand grabbed his neck. He was not surprised at the ease with which he was fastened in Ereanis' grip, but found the action itself startling and gained even more of his ability to think after the rush of surprise washed over him. Ereanis, though had no intention of letting the man he held loose too much of his arousal. "You see," he said turning Richard around and holding the wide eyed Richard against his own body as easily as if he were a little child, "The combination of a particularly interesting form of bondage and some lovely teasing by Rebecca, has left him in a state where his speech is restricted to moans."





Chelsea couldn't believe these people. She knew this wasn't exactly rape, since they had come in smiling and enjoying themselves. Even now Richard's eyes were glazing with lust as she let her eyes roam his body hungrily. Chelsea had never really understood what being dominated, and what submission meant. One day she had been at a friends house and while checking her mail on his computer, come across some interesting bookmarks. Oddly enough, though they scared her, she found herself more curious about it than anything else. But without guidance and having rushed a bit too quickly into everything, she found herself only partially satisfied. She enjoyed being used hard by her dominant 'girlfriend' but it seemed more like she was a toy, used and carefully put back in its drawer. There was little attention and tenderness that she had recieved from her friend, other than in the days of courtship. She had been genuinely hurt when Carrie had told her that she could do whwatever she wished, and that the relationship could hardly be expected to be exclusive. No, Ereanis thought, having easily followed her thoughts, this woman was not being loved, or even much cared for, and deserved better. However, Chelsea's logic and thought process left her when she felt Rebecca's hands hold her own. Suddenly she was very aware of the woman standing behind her, breasts pressed into her back and legs to hers.





"Perhaps you would like a closer look?" murmured Ereanis. He stepped forward and carried Richard effortlessly along with him.





Richard couldn't believe he was being put on display. Like some sort of pet to be proudly displayed before guests. The thought twisted his gut with lust and forced a moan form his throat. He knew his cock was twitching but couldn't do a thing about it. Instead he could only moan louder.





"Richard loves to be helpless and forced on display," whispered Rebecca eductively in Chelsea's ear. "See the way his cock is twitching? He's got so much cum built up, just waiting to squirt it out. If he's good, we might just let him later on. Why don't you help him?" Chelsea, couldn't have lifted her arms to do a thing, but Rebecca held them in her and guided them to Richard's flaccid penis.





Ereanis smiled at the feel of Richard quivering, shivering and whimpering helplessly as he was felt over and explored. Turning his gaze back to the two women he watched in content as Rebecca continued murmuring pointers and advice into Chelsea's ear, her hands now sliding up and down the blue eyed beauty's body.





Chelsea's hand seemed to move of its own will. She was barely conscious of the fact that she was gently rubbing and trying to stroke the cock to life, eliciting whimpers and gasps in response. On the other hand, she was fully aware of the hands teasing her, sliding up her thighs and around her breasts, brush the nape of her neck and settling on her waist, thumbs moving in small circles high on her bottom.





"Enough," commanded Ereanis, his voice suddenly forceful, enogh so that not only did Chelsea stop, but involuntarily, so did Rebecca, chuckling to herself at the ability of Ereanis to command in a voice so strongly that other's had litle option but to obey. "He has been this way for a long time and it will be damaging if you go farther," he said in a softer voice to Chelsea. "When do you get off work?" he asked.





Chelsea had to take a breath to refocus. It was difficult when all she wanted to do right now was get on her knees and say 'Yes Master' to any and everything that came out of Ereanis mouth. That voice that had stopped Rebecca had left a wet, dribbling and messy present for Chelsea within the confines of her panties. "After half an hour," she managed to stammer out.





"Then meet us at the front door. We should have finished our meals by then," murmured Rebecca, completing the words by placing a soft kiss on the unsteady Chelsea's neck.





"Ok," was all she managed to say, and shakily left.





"Rebecca, help me get Richard dressed," came Ereanis voice after Chelsea had gone and together, the two of them began to dress the man. It took a few minutes before they were all presentable, and left the washrooms to head back to their table.





The table had been cleared and their waiters reaedy with dessert menu's. No one had noticed what had happened between the trio, and aside from a few curious glances at all three making their way back towards the table, no one paid them any attention. Rebecca was uncertain how much of this was caused by Ereanis, and how much by something else. Shaking her head resolutely she could only sigh in amusement as they took their seats and comforted Richard, calming the man, before they began to order.





Richard found that each touch brought him back to reality, and as before, brough with it the aches and pains. Smiling softly in contentment, he sighed happily, pressed and propped between Ereani and Rebecca. It took some time, but after a bit, what the waiters had assumed was his drunk as a skunk appearance, faded and he was himself, albeit a bit sore, once more. That too vanished halfway through dessert as Ereanis smiled a bit and alleviated some of the man's discomfort. It seemed true thievery to rob the man of all the pain, since he enjoyed some of his aches, and so Ereanis left just enough to keep him happily throbbing away.





Dessert finished shortly after with little sexual innuendo, all three craving th sugar and Ereanis being the only one who savoured each bite, yet seemed to put away more than the both of them. To the raised eyebrows and amused looks, he only shrugged and said, "Well, I may not need food to sustain myself, but it is a source of energy and sometimes it does bode well for those around that I do feed of them." He finished with a chuckle as Rebecca glanced at a confsued Richard, knowing full well how exhausted the man was and could easily guess that it would not be wise for him to expend himself anymore. Soon though, dessert was over and all three made their way curiously to the reception area. Rebecca and Richard were disappointed, not being able to find Chelsea, but Ereanis only smiled. He knew exactly where she was. They saw her on their way to the car, huddled in her coat, glancing around nervously, her hands tucked into the pockets.





"We're glad to see you here," murmured Ereanis, his voice carrying easily on the quiet, cold air of the winter night.





Chelsea hadn't been sure she wanted to come. A flood of emotions had assaulted her once she had left. She had done so many things that were so obviously inacceptable in her work place, that they were not even in any of the guidelines, she was sure. Yet, she felt no wrong and instead sensed a place for herself. It seemed more than a bit odd because not only for the fact that she knew these people, but for the more important reason that despite the very clear lack of knowledge, she found her current relationship to be what it was. A facade, albeit a passionate one, between two people who only wanted mutual gain and didn't care beyond the basic politeness for each other. When was the last time she had been held as she drifted to sleep? When was the last time she had wanted to kneel, nude and face down in the bedroom, toys in outstretched arms, simply because she felt like it? There was no sorrow, only a mild anger at herself for allowing such a blatant abuse of herself. Why not explore these feelings that seemed to have intwined themselves into her heart so deeply? So it was with trepidition, nervousness and a bit more than slight excitement, that she stood beside their car. It wasn't hard to figure out which one it was. All it took was a question to the doorman on her way to collect her coat.





"I'm not sure what you're wanting..." she began in a slight voice, unsure of how to proceed.





"I assure you, you're free to leave whenever you like, and we have nothing harmful planned." said Rebecca, softly, her face serious as she quickly stepped forward to hold Rebecca's arms and comfort her. She might not have been as adept at thought reading, but she knew, somehow, that this woman was an emotional mess in her current state. Ereanis, it seemed would not be able to draw on them as he might have with others, she realised quickly and smiled inwardly, as the proof of his care and attention to people showed through in that one very simple fact.





"Ok," she mumbled softly, looking up into Rebecca's face and finding nothing but tenderness in those amber orbs.





"Let us be on our way then," said a smiling Ereanis, and they all piled into the car. They sat in the same way they had come, and Chelsea joined Rebecca in the back. The drive was more enjoyable and less uncomfortable than expected by the barmaid, with all four of the people within the car, discussing and talking about their jobs and hobbies. Chelsea, felt more and more at ease and was soon even smiling and joking.





"So, you're both working at the same office?" she asked softly as the conversation flowed.





"Pretty much, though we might be leaving soon." answered Rebecca.





"Oh? How come?" asked Chelsea curiously. They seemed a bit young for retirement and she hoped they were not moving.





"Well," began Rebecca wondering how to put it diplomatically. She was saved by Ereanis.





"I have offered to employ them for performing considerably more rewarding tasks," said Ereanis matter of factly.





Chelsea had her doubts. What kind of employer maintained such 'close' relationships with their employees?





"Don't worry," Richard said, grinning and a chuckle escaping his mouth as he saw her facial expression in the rear view mirror. "We'd have done that bit for free. But he does have a few jobs for us and they are more rewarding. You get tired of working in one place for too long. I suppose Rebecca and myself needed a challenge. We're home," he said as he pulled into Rebecca's garage. A button from her remote sent the door open and the darkness, suddenly seemed to Chelsea to jolt the sexual tension into the air.





They all got out of the car and entered the main house quickly. The night was a bit chillier than usual and none really wanted to stay out for too long, though Ereanis didn't seem to mind in the least. Chelsea was just beginning to have her first doubts when Rebecca spoke.





"Get up stairs, strip off and come back down immediately slave," she commanded, her voice as hard as stone. Richard was quick to obey.





"Yes Mistress," he murmured and head upstairs swiftly.





"Why don't we have a little chat while he comes back down?" asked Rebecca as she took Chelsea's coat and they made their way into the foyer.





"Sure," mumbled Chelsea.





Ereanis led the way and guided Chelsea to the sofa, perching himself on the single seater to the side, leaving the place beside her free for Rebecca. Once they were all seated, Ereanis spoke. "I do not know your history," he began, "but I know that you are not truly happy. Here, we share each other and have no qualms about enjoying each other. I would advise you to affirm to yourself and to us where you stand, even if for no longer than the duration of this night." he said softly. "We would like for you to enjoy yourself and that would be a passing fancy if you are unable to do so. After this night we can decide which path we wish to follow and how best to help you on yours." he finished tenderly.





"I don't know where this might be leading to," began Chelsea, her confusion decreasing with each word and surety growing in her mind. "But I want to ... " she paused, suddenly unable to speak and a blush creeping up her cheeks.





"Submit?" asked rebecca silently from beside her, and after recieving a grateful nod, went on. "Well that shouldn't be a problem, dear. But slaves do not wear clothes in this house, unless directed by us."





Chelsea's stomach twisted and she couldn't stop the words, "Yes Mistress," from escaping her lips. She stood quickly and began fumbling about her dress, when an amused Ereanis stopped her.





"Stop Chelsea. Why don't we wait for Richard?" he asked with an inflection to his tone that sent shivers down the woman's back.





As if on cue, Richard stepped into the foyer and dropped to his hands and knees. He could already feel the desire rising quickly in the room and walked to the center to stand beside Chelsea. He was nude, except for the ribbon that was still wrapped around his, once more throbbing, cock.







"Richard dear," murmured Rebecca, standing up and moving towards Ereanis, taking a new seat in his lap, "be a darl and undress Chelsea, would you?" she asked softly, dismissing them and nuzzling against Ereanis' cheek. She was already rather aroused at the sight of Richard, and her dismissal of them with a turn of her head, sent a moan out of Chelsea's lips, that she had so wickedly failed to hide.





Who were these people, she wondered to herself. Just that one dismissal of Rebecca's so she could cuddle with Ereanis, as though she wasn't interested in her sent shivers down her spine. Chelsea hadn't ever really come across the fetish known commonly as objectification. Thus, she had no label for her reaction to the seemingly unobtrusive and subtle, yet very significant act that Rebecca had performed. Her face flushed and breathing heavy, she could only stay still as Richard began to carefully take off her clothes.





As though he wasn't aroused enough, the restrained man found himself throbbing and twitching helplessly as he began to remove her clothing. He started with her shoes, unstrapping both of the small sensible heels and then gently pulling of one and then the other, only pausing to assure her that she could use his back for support. Next he took off the skirt, gently unzipping it from the side and slipping it to her ankles, where he bent to remove it from her ankles, putting every ounce of his servitude and concentration on his assigned task. Not only did he want to perform well and avoid showing too obvious signs of pleasure since those hurt, but he also wanted to show Chelsea with his actions that this was truly a safe place. He had gotten the message from Ereanis while he was upstairs changing that the girl needed to be dealt with caution, due to 'certain circumstances' in her past. Being an obediant slave, he neither questioned the observation nor doubted the need for the measure of control and care and did what he did best. Obeyed.





As he continued by taking off the shirt next and then the bra, he marvelled at how aroused the woman was. Her chest heaved and her eyes, when they met him after he stepped behind to unhook the bra and slip it off first one arm and then the other, were filled with desperation. She nearly loved the treatment as much as he did, and the decisiveness of each action only made her lust soar higher. Finally it was time for her panties, and though the smell had been reaching him already, the sweet, musky aroma brought a shiver to Richard's spine and made him force his eyes close due to the pain of his now frantic and unaviodable twitching cock. He had an urge to smell and taste them and fought it down, hands shaking as he pulled them down, letting Chelsea step out of them.





Rebecca had not been watching, and neither had Ereanis, but both felt the waves of lust soar as the panties came off and even to someone standing across the room, the smell would have been rather obvious. So it was with a smile that Ereanis and Rebecca escaped a soft delicate kiss, sharing the moment of calm before the storm, so to speak.





"Richard," commanded Ereanis, his tone making the man shudder, but with nothing close to repugnance, "Go and put her clothes away in the bedroom and hurry down."





"Yes Master," he said, and scurried off, leaving Chelsea standing nude and shivering, her juices flowing uninhibited down her thighs.





Rebecca smiled wickedly as she continued to kiss Ereanis, still ignoring the woman purposely, her hands wandering under Ereanis shirt as his own opened her dress. Desire welled in the woman and it took a rather large amount of effort not to straddle Ereanis and grind herself against his thigh while his tongue roved her mouth. Fortunately, Ereanis chuckled and removed the temptation by guiding ehr to her feet before him. She took the distraction gladly, and stood, immediately causing the dress to fall down her body, its smooth texture offering no grip and now unsupported by the measly length of cloth around her neck. With no undies of any kind on, she was nude, except for the heels, which she decided to keep. After all, the straps would ensure they complimented her skin nicely and the entire get up would be rather... right, she finished with a wicked mental chuckle. Instead she took off the earings and walked casually over to put them away in a side table across the sitting area, on the other side of the couch.





Richard stepped in just as she was straightened and caught the look in her eye. A long night, he thought silently to himself, already having familiarised himself with that particular look, a very long and very 'hard' night in more ways than one.





"Richard, you bad boy." she purred, crooking one finger to beckon him to her, "Look what you made me do? A Mistress should not have to undress herself, now should she?" Promptly grabbing his hair and twisting his head back as he got close enough, she forced him to his knees.





"No Mistress. Sorry mistress." said Richard.





"I suppose we shall have to punish you later." she purred and turned, pulling him along with her as she strode back past Chelsea. She paused for a second to grab the woman's hair in a vise grip and twist her head back. "Slave's kneel."





Those two words would have been enough to make Chelsea orgasm right there, but she stopped her body and fought back the lust. "Yes Mistress," she groaned, her knees weak and unable to support her weight. The woman fell to her knees the moment Rebecca let her go, head down, back and chest heaving, her gasps for breath audible. Rebecca, needn't even have glanced at Richard to make sure the man was already on his knees, hands behind his back with his neck bent forward and looking at his toes. She had kept her grip for that purpose. She let go of both the slaves and instead stalked towards Ereanis.





He had no other word for it. Her hips swayed and her hair swung tantalisingly at her back with each step, and she seemed to truly stalk. Ereanis found the sight enticing and amusing since he could tell her arousal and the fact that her hips belied just how desperate was her need to touch him. But she would wait, he knew, and chuckled inwardly as he stood and offered her the seat with a wave of his hand. He had other plans for her. "Chelsea," me commanded, his voice jerking the woman's head back and forcing her dilated orbs up to meet his. "Come here," he murmured.





"Yes Master." she said in a breathy voice. Chelsea couldn't refuse the order. She felt her pussy spasm and fluids dribble down her thighs as she crawled forward. She felt the soft carpeting rub across her palms and knees, sending twinges of pleasure shooting through her mind. How could he read her so easily? and Rebecca... she seemed a goddess to Chelsea, sitting in the sofa, one leg draped over the side and the other curled atop the first, her foot gently rubbing against her calves, her breasts full and not seeming obtrusive, but rather complimenting each movement she made. Her eyes darted back to the pair of shoes inches from her fingers and fell back to her knees.





"Why don't you help Master out of his clothes?" asked Rebecca in a purr as her fingers trailed lazy circles over her thighs, eliciting very vocal reactions from both Richard and Chelsea, the both of them fighting back moans.





"Yes Mistress," breathed Chelsea and proceeded.





Her fingers shook as they reached for the laces. She forced herself to calm down and gently began to untie his shoes, then hold them steady as Ereanis stepped out of first one and then the other. Ereanis had purposely stood in order to make this task a bit harder for the already dazed woman. Next, she rolled down his socks and pulled of one, then the other. Knowing better, she did not reach for his pants. This was a test, she could tell by now, and she was determined to perform as a real slave would. Instead she stood and proceeded with the jacket, removing it carefully and placing it across the arm of the longer sofa beside Rebecca's, then turning back. Suddenly Ereanis was facing her, and smiling softly, letting her know in that small soft smile that he found her manner just perfect. Chelsea couldn't breathe for a second and nearly moaned, biting her lip to stifle the sound and went to her knees. She unbuckled his belt and opened his pants, sliding them down and holding them so Ereanis might step out of each leg one at a time. These went beside the jacket and she stood once more, to take of the tie and shirt, then the vest. Finally, she fell back to her knees to pull off his underwear, and though she had spent some time orally pleasing her Master, for she knew he was truly that by now, it had all been a blur and she found herself moaning as she saw him hanging, half hard half soft and still relatively large.





"Such slutty sounds you make slave," he murmured, enticing so easily yet another moan. "Richard," he ordered and stepped back, leaving Chelsea blinking, trying to re-orient herself as she furiously fought back an orgasm. She did not think of the reason at that moment, but had she, it would have been fairly obvious. Permission had not been granted. "Richard, crawl upstairs," purred Ereanis. "Chelsea, follow him," he commanded and held a hand out to Rebecca.





It took a flex of his will to ensure that the room would have a few extra toys, and 'features'. The fun and games were about to begin.





*****





Soon Chelsea found herself in a bedroom. Except that it was a bit large to be an average bedroom and her eyes were wide at the sight of the wall filled with toys. She glanced at Richard who only smiled softly and nodded once before making his way, Chelsea wisely following, to the center of the room. They knelt and waited as Ereanis and Rebecca entered behind them.





"Richard," commanded Rebecca, her voice like tempered steel as she strode towards the wall.





"Yes Mistress?" he asked, head bowed, breathing heavy as his body shook. He already needed no confirmation, her voice being enough, of what was to come.





"Come here," she ordered as she reached the wall and turned around.





"Yes Mistress," he said, quickly following.





"Stand up," she said once he had obeyed
 and come close enough. Once he stood, her hands picked a padded blindfold from the wall, tying it around the man. Next, came a pair of ear plugs and ring gag.





Ereanis in the meantime had taken a seat on the bed and called Chelsea to him. The blond woman was now standing beside him, legs spread wide, hands behind her head, where they had been ordered to stay, and gasping, moaning and nodding as his fingers caressed her inner thighs. "Do you see how frantically his cock is twitching?" asked Ereanis inquisitively, his tone giving nothing away as he toyed helplessly with the woman. "He may be being punished for something he could not have avoided, but it isn't a true punishment and he will enjoy every minute of it." Ereanis punctuated 'enjoy every minute' by plaing three swift swats across Chelsea's bottom, making her moan even louder and shiver, her body so hot with need her skin was flushed and fluids now tickling past her knees.





Rebecca merely smiled at the sounds coming from Chelsea, not sure if she pitied the girl or envied her, being caught in Ereanis far too intuitive attentions and abilities. She focused her mind back to the task at hand and tied off another length of rope along Richard's arms and finally knotted another length of rope lying on the ground, one that was secured to the spreader bar that kept Richard on his knees and bent backwards. She smiled at her handiwork, and indeed she was proud.





Richard was on his knees, his hands held together by a long length of rope, starting first at chest, just under his armpits, before coming up behind his neck and winding around his arms, knots placed at just the right intervals to ensure each movement caused the ropes to tightend&nbsp; against his chest and cut off his breath, forcing him to relax and ease the strain before he could draw in a careful breath. He might have been on his knees, but those were spread wide and he was well aware of the vulnerability to his genitals.





Rebecca turned to Ereanis and asked for the finishing touch. "Love, could you move him to the center of the room?" she asked innocently, smiling at Chelsea's groan and quaking knees.





"Of course," said Ereanis, his head bowing as he pulled his fingers that had been doing wonders to Chelsea's pussy and pushed them into her mouth. "Clean your mess, slave," he commanded non chalantly as he stood in front of her.





Chelsea couldn't believe how easily they seemed to drive her nuts. The gentle touches could be turned so much 'dirtier' with just a change in tone that it kept her on guard, nearly constantly fighting orgasm and ensuring speech and thought was impossible. "Yes Master," she moaned loudly and sucked his fingers with abandon, unable and unwilling to allow herself to even pretend control anymore. "Such a little slut," purred a voice in her ear, and she realised she had been a bit lost in her sucking. The words, voice and realisation all made her moan louder and her nails dig into each hand, desperately trying to stop from cumming.





"Enough," chuckled Ereanis, smiling at her gently and kissing her before moving to Richard.





Richard could not hear or see. He could smell, and the scent of Chelsea hit him full force as Ereanis wiped his finger's across the man's lips before he lifted him off the ground and gently set him back down in the center of the room. The strength was a tell tale sign and Richard could easily guess it was Ereanis that had lifted him, but he no longer knew where he was, where everyone else was and was thoroughly dazed. He was also just as thoroughly aroused. His cock never stopping it twitching dance.





"Thank you love," murmured Rebecca with a kiss and went to retrieve the cat of nine tails that hung on the walls. The whip was truly lovely and would mark his skin easily. Each leather braid was thin but heavy, done so tight that the weight surprised her. As an added pleasure, each braid had small, subtle knots in it, small imperfections that she knew Richard would appreciate. A test flick against her own hand confirmed that it wasn't too harsh and she moved in front of the temporarily blind and deaf man. "Chelsea, love," she murmured softly as she spent a moment considering her position and the areas she intended to hit and those tob e avoided. "You will count, and if you miss a beat, we will add another to make up for it." she said grinning and down flashed the braids.





Richard felt the weight of the braids, and knew it was a whip, but had no clue just which kind. He dismissed the idea of a flogger as the burn shot through a moment later, sprinting up his thigh, straight towards his head. He could only moan in reponse.





"One," gasped Chelsea, as Ereanis decided to use the opportunity for a bit of fun. Two of his fingers were inside her pussy, and as she spoke, they slowly stroke her g-spot forward and then back. Her eyes fluttered for a second and she nearly collapsed when she said two.





Richard moaned louder, when the cat fell on his left waist.





Rebecca felt the weight and the ease with which the tails fit into her hands. So it was with barely any effort that she marked Richard's body, over and over, without missing or misplacing a strike by even an inch. His thighs, his cock, his balls, his ass, his waist, hips, chest, nipples, back, feet... she worked over and over, stopping at twenty eight strokes. She had kept count, even though Ereanis had made Chelsea miss three.





"You missed three," whispered Ereanis with a chuckle and pulled his hand out of the woman. "You should apologise to Richard later," he said as he walked towards the kneeling, drooling, gasping man, and rubbed his fingers across his nose and mouth, letting Chelsea's fluids assault the man's remaining senses once more.





"Come here Chelsea," ordered Rebecca, tossing the whip aside and gasping from lust. Her pussy was dripping helplessly and she had one last thing to do.





"Yes Mistress," moaned Chelsea as she dropped to her knees and crawled towards the three people in the middle of the room.





"You missed three counts." said Rebecca, her eyes narrowing with pleasure as she said her next words. "So your punishment will be to make him cum three times."





"Yes Mistress," groaned the woman helplessly as her pussy spasmed over and over, the almost pre orgasmic sensations sending jolts of pleasure, so intense, though her, that she almost fell to her side.





Ereanis smiled and bent down, pulling of Richard's bond with just a short tug. "Once in each hole," he ordered Chelsea and smiled at Rebecca's raised eyebrows. He had been very careful and had timed the misses just perfectly.





Chelsea felt her body burn as she attacked Richard's, very quickly growing cock with her mouth. She knew he might not last long the first time, and wanted to taste him first.





Richard moaned loudly through the gag and jerked, twitching and shivering as his cock found release in the form of a mouth moving over his shaft. He knew he wouldn't last long, he could already feel his cock throbbing, fully hard and his orgasms earlier having already readied him to cum. He was surprised when his blindfold and ear plugs came off, and blinked a few times before his eyes adjusted enough to make sense of what he was looking at. Chelsea was bent over his penis, hungrily sucking and licking, moaning against his cock as she worked him towards his orgasm with her considerable skill. Ereanis was standing in front of him, his hard cock so close to his face her could smell the pre cum already coating the head in a clear film. Rebecca was kneeling behind him and whispering into his ear as something smooth and slick rubbed between his ass cheeks. Then his world exploded in light. "Here's your reward for being a good little slave," she whispered and both Ereanis and Rebecca pushed into him. Making him gag and shiver, helplessly moaning.





Rebecca groaned behind Richard as the strap on pushed deeper into her own pussy before finally pushing through Richard's tight hole. Ereanis hissed his own pleasure, forcing himself down Richard's open mouth and into his throat, his cock squeezed and feeling the vibration of the man's moan. Richard came first and immediately, followed shortly by Chelsea, her throat gagging as she pushed herself down on Richard's cock, almost getting to the base as he spurted his cum into her throat, and a lot of it. Rebecca quickly after, her pussy spasming around the toy and Ereanis last, shooting his own cum into the man's throat. They lay gasping for a few moments before Ereanis pulled out of the man's throat. He offered not a word and only plucked at a strand of rope, effectively releasing Richard from his bonds. Rebecca followed his lead and untied the spreader bars and soon the man was lying on his back, relearning how to breathe as his gag, the last item, was removed. "You're not done yet slave," said Rebecca in a wicked purr as she moved around to sit on her ankles between the man's legs. "Move a bit higher slave," she whispered into Chelsea's ear, guiding the woman with a hand on her hips and a holding Richard's still hard cock with her other hand. It didn't take long and soon Chelsea found herself sinking Richard's cock into her pussy, her moan loud and throaty, full of lust, her pussy spasming around the intrusion. Rebecca had no intention to wait and soon pumped away into the man's anus, hard and fast, each thrust causing his cock to throb and twitch helplessly in Chelsea's pussy. A finger and then two delved suddenly into Chelsea's ass, fingering and stroking the woman and Richard's cock inside her. The former could not hold back, and screamed her orgasm, or tried to. Ereanis gladly grabbed her head and pushed himself into Chelsea's throat, which only served to shoot her back into yet another orgasm. Her vision span and she knew she would cum many more times, but that she would not be aware or even awake for those. Rebecca only smiled with Ereanis as they worked the two submissive for nearly an hour, Rebecca squeezing Richards dick at the base, or his teticles, hard and forcing his orgasm to a stop everytime he came close.





Richard couldn't believe the pleasure and was soon begging, "Please Mistress, let me cum, oh pease... oooooohhh..." Finally when his begging had become nearly incoherent, Rebecca let the man have his orgasm, forcing yet another orgasm from Chelsea. The blonde girl was now oblivious to everything and found herself moaning and screaming nearly continuously as climax after climax shattered her, smashing into her consecutively. She only realised that Rebecca was gone from behind her when she felt Richard's cock leave her pussy and force its way, thoroughly lubed with her many many juices, into her ass. Her scream this time was louder and she forced herself down, squirting her juices all over Richard's stomach and chest.





Rebecca meanwhile had planted her pussy on Richard's moaning mouth, which now worked furiously to lick and suck her pussy to orgasm after orgasm while she herself did the same to Chelsea. Ereanis' cock was buried deep inside her ass and she felt each thrust grind into her, moaning and groaning, whimpering and screaming into the other woman's pussy, biting, tugging and licking the other woman to one brutal orgasm after another.





Ereanis paused, pulling out of Rebecca's bottom long enough to thrust his cock into her pussy, driving the woman nearly hysterical in her lust. Over and over he switched, sometimes pulling out to push himself down Richard's throat and then back into Rebecca. And so they went on for half an hour more, Ereanis making each of them scream, stimulating Rebecca, who in turn did the same to Chelsea, which naturally caused Richard to only scream his pleasure louder.





Chelsea was lost in the flood of sensations. Rebecca's hands had found her nippled and the rough treatment they were recieving, pinches and twists and the occasional suckling and biting, sent her into semi consciousness. She felt as though she passed out and only realised it was not true, but that she had been in one continous orgasm after another, when her eyes came back into focus long enoguh for her to have yet another and final orgasm. She was still atop Richard when her last moan came through rather weakly and she began to pass out, along with Richard and Rebecca, as the trio's vision faded into black. They had all orgasmed far more than was normal. Far more than was possible, it seemed to her.





Ereanis had come as well but only sighed as he pulled out of Rebecca, standing and breathing heavily, feeling bloated from energy and the feed he had just partaken. He shook himself and moved the three cum covered bodies to the bed, tucking them in against each other and covering them with blankets while he smiled tenderly down at them. Perhaps he had found love, or perhaps he had found family. Likely he had discovered both. Just as Chelsea had found her place as well. He chuckled when he thought of how much they had cum and as glad they hadn't been on the bed, since the fluids would have easily covered the blankets quite literally. His bewilderment and surprise was genuine as he thought of their earlier exploits and realised that the reason he felt so full was because Chelsea, despite everything ele, served an additional purpose. She amplified his feeds. He could not believe the woman's ability to arouse emotion in others and shook his head self depreciatingly as he headed out of the door to a balcony and stood gazing at the stars. Winter was fast approaching, but his spring was here already. A quick mental check made sure everyone was well and 
sleeping happily. Indeed, spring was here, if not in full bloom, at the very least, in full readiness.





END CHAPTER 3







NOTE: This chapter was very largely based on sex. I could have elaborated even more on certain scenes and circumstances, even acts, but then the chapter would simply have been too much sex (If ever there was such a thing). So I've kept things short, with just enough of a description (I hope), for you to be able to happily imagine what you wish to. The next chapter will see more of a 'plot development' going on and Ereanis' actual purpose. I hope everyone has liked it all so far. For any comments, critiques or opinions in general, let me know.

Until next time, ta.

THE BURNING BLADE



By Whisper







CHAPTER 4 - BATTLE PLANS





He gazed at the night sky, a soft smile playing on his lips. With his hands resting on the guard rail and angled towards the side as he was, Ereanis had a view of the bedroom, restricted only by the gently floating and blowing drapes, and the more uninhibited sight of the hills behind the borders of the house. The content smile on his face was no act, and despite the tumultous situation he found himself in, he felt more sure than he had in a long time, that things would eventually work out. This hardly meant that he wasn't to plan and prepare, both himself and those he cared for, in lieu of the seemingly constantly shifting future and the possibilities for both disaster and calamity. A slight frown marred his features as he shifted through the course of events to discern the best safest route for all of them.





They aren't really going to understand the finance, he thought to himself, faintly amused at the idea. A problem that needed solving. He had paid for their dinner last night, but neither Rebecca nor Richard, or even Chelsea for that matter, had wondered where he had got the money. He supposed he might have to help them understand that aspect first. Relatively simple since he could rather effortlessly adapt his abilities to this new 'banking' system. He chuckled as he realised that humans, throughout history had been notoriously ingenious when it came to protecting their possessions, and money was no exception. In fact they seemed to find more and more protocols and safeguards so quick that they often times confused themselves rather effortlessly.





"What're ye about?" came a sleepy voice as Rebecca stepped out from behind the curtains, stark naked and rubbing her eyes as she blinked and stepped closer to him.





Ereanis smile broaded and his eyes held a gentle light as he took the woman in his arms wordlessly, laying a gentle kiss on her lips, his worries and earlier ponderings floating away in the slight breeze. There would be time for that on the morrow, he decided and held the woman close against his body, taking comfort in the arms that wrapped around his neck and the breath against his neck as Rebecca nuzzled into him. "Nothing at all," he murmured and sighed in contentment.





Rebecca didn't understand how they had gotten so close. It hadn't been two days, yet she knew that Ereanis was one of those people she would be hard pressed to loose. The thought scared her more than a bit, but not because Ereanis wasn't human or because he might have lied. She was fairly sure that he had used neither trickery nor wiles to find his way into her heart. In fact, she doubted he had even wanted to, so scared was he of harm coming to them when they had met but tens of hours ago. Yet, here they stood, and Rebecca found herself scared, for a very pecularly human reason. She had worked hard to get over the deaths of her parents, and had in her juvenile mind decided never to let herself be that caring again. Yet she knew she could not keep that promise to herself. It was a selfish ideal, based entirely on self preservation that would hurt her deeper and more subtly.





Ereanis smiled as he followed her thoughts. She could have been scared or angry for so many reasons, yet she had picked the most personal one and that one act instilled a great calm in him. She was scared to loose him. Ereanis made a decision, standing under the stars, the chill breeze blowing, protecting her body from it by wrapping her up in his arms, content and at peace, having finally found his place. He would not loose. The last war may have been won, at least to most, but it had been a glaring loss to Ereanis. Too much blood had been spilt. He would find a way, somehow, and win this time. He owed that much at least.





"Come to bed," murmured Rebecca, her face turning up, eyes peaceful and a small smile playing on her lips as she came to her own conclusions about where they were all heading and how she wished to journey there. "Come," she said softly, and holding his hand, led him to bed. It was a tight fit, but comfortably so and when their eyes closed, bodies entwined, contentment could be felt seeping through the room, like some thick syrup, sweet and thick coating your throat.





--





Chelsea woke slowly, feeling not sore at all, but instead a heaviness in her limbs that thrummed satisfcation and laziness. Her eyes fluttered open gently and she tried to quickly recall last nights' activities. They had a wild time alright, she groaned as she tried to move her legs and felt more of the lazy heaviness make her back arch andd stretch contentedly.





"Hello there," called Rebecca softly as she stepped out of the bathroom covered in a robe. "Richard's working on breakfast, so why don't you wash up hun?" she said, walking towards the bed, giving the surprised and more than slightly awkward feeling Chelsea a gentle kiss, then moving to the built-in wardrobe beside the bed and dropped the robe. "Go on, I left you a robe in there," she urged, smiling in an amused way as she slipped on a pair of panties and bra.





"Okay," mumbled a subdued Chelsea before getting up and scampering into the bathroom. She didn't bother locking the door and only closed it, feeling for some reason as though locking it was wrong. The thought was followed quickly by a frown and she shook her head as she washed her face. Her thoughts however did not stop there, and she found herself a tad bit confused. She didn't know what to do. She supposed she could take it one step at a time, but thoughts of doubt and worry, fear of having made a mistake crashed through her suddenly and she found herself panicking. Stillness seemed to quickly descend as she recalled something she had felt more than once already. She belonged. There was not the least bit of awkwardness in Rebecca's manner just moments ago, and the comfort level made her fearful that this really was too good to be true. So it was with a determined glance and whisper of "Baby steps," that she began to wash her face and mouth. If things were going to work out, they would, and honestly, what was the point of fretting over something she had no control over? Another thought nearly sent her into yet another panic - the fact that she was nude. This was even quicker sublimated as she whirled towards the door and saw a robe hanging on the bathroom door. Recalling Rebecca's words, she relaxed and smiled, marvelling at how thoughtful these people were.





Finishing up her morning rituals, she left the bathroom and slowly wandered downstairs. Led by the sounds of chatter and a distinctly warm and familiar chuckle, she turned towards the kitchen and headed towards the sounds a bit timidly.





"Morning," said Rebecca with a smile as she walked in, her disarming manner instantly drawing a grin from herself.





"Morning." she murmured and looked around for an empty chair.





"Come here," said Ereanis chuckling, patting the empty chair to one side of him.





"Thanks," came her murmured reply and she made her way to the offered seat.





"Bacon, eggs and sausage?" offered Richard, turning from the stove to smile at her as well.





Chelsea forced herself to gulp past the lump in her throat. How could they be so casual, she wondered. It simply wasn't normal. Last night they had gotten away with the excuse of Ereanis being their 'employer', the sheer sexual tension in her allowing her to shove all other thoughts aside. But she was sober now, and things didn't add up. They were sitting around the platform opposite the stove, Ereanis naked except for his towel (and what was that tatto over his body?), Richard half dressed with an apron and a pair of boxers, his clothes hung over a chair in the living room and Rebecca the only one fully clothed.





"I assure you we will explain, sweet Chelsea, but you must eat. I am sure you are hungry," murmured Ereanis, drawing her back to reality as her stomach grumbled. Chelsea realised that she hadn't been paying attention and had stayed quiet for quite a bit, so lost was she in her thoughts. She only nodded, still dazed and confused, not knowing what to ask first, whether to ask at all or wait for a more oportune moment, or even if she were over reacting or not.





"Rebecca, Richard and myself are a trio," began Ereanis, answering her questions and deciding to finish this before the poor woman was even more lost and confused. Might as well give her some information for her brain to mull over, he thought with a chuckle. "They're both going to hand in their resignations today and should be back around lunch time. It is not yet time for me to explain my own role in everything, but you can rest easy knowing it is nothing harmful. I will let you know everything, but you are still a bit dazed and confused at the moment. You are welcome to spend the day with myself, or go home," he added with a bow of his head, "as you wish. The decision is entirely yours. I will miss your company, but there are no strings attached here."





"Thanks," said Chelsea after a pause. "I appreciate that."





"I'll drop you off on the way to work," said Rebecca smiling, patting the relieved woman's hand.





"After you're done, I'll show you where your clothes are," said Richard with a smile as he sat opposite Chelsea and began to wolf down his toast and eggs.





That didn't take long. Chelsea felt her hunger the moment she took her first bite of toast, and in a few minutes had managed to clean her plate. She felt slightly bashful for a moment before she realised that the other three were just finishing up as well.





"Come on," motioned Richard and moved upstairs, followed shortly by Chelsea.





"She's scared out of her wits," sighed Rebecca as she got up and took a seat on Ereanis lap.





"Yes," accepted Ereanis, offering nothing more and only agreeing, waiting for Rebecca to speak her mind.





"Why are we growing so attached so very quickly?" she asked Ereanis while she rested her head against his chest, his hands holding her. Rebecca was growing a bit scared with the changes. Maybe she thought they were about to slow down, but as things stood, that seemed to be a very distant fancy of a little girl. Instead she took comfort in the hands that held her, trusting fully in Ereanis to be good and do as such a being would.





"Fate, destiny, opportunity, choices... who knows, and does it really matter?" asked Ereanis softly. "There is a very human emotion. It is a strange one. Once it manifests itself, by means you might consider 'good' or 'bad', it leaves you helpless to fight against it. Do you know what it is?"





"Love?" asked Rebecca softly.





"No," whispered Ereanis. "Love comes with its passions, and love alone will never have the power to stop your struggles against it. Even though you love, you might fight and struggle, in some way or the other, for some reason or another. But care," he whispered, pulling Rebecca's face up to lay a gentle kiss on those soft lips, "care, will wash away everything else, but the person it is directed at. A mothers care, a lovers care, a friends care and even another human's care." he finished.





Rebecca found herself stiilled by his words. He was right. Most people who had loved each other had almost always fought and made each other sad, albeit briefly most of the time. The type of 'Love' that most people knew of was an emotion based in an extreme. It was lovely, but when threatened, it resembled a snake and the reaction would be filled with venom. If she had fallen in love with Ereanis and had realised that it had been a result of his abilities, she would have begun to hate him, or at the very least been rather sorely angry at him. But to care for someone, was another thing altogether. She truly cared for Ereanis, and what that meant was relatively simple. She wanted him to be happy.





"Ready," said Chelsea as she wandered back downstairs, her head bent down as she worked to tie her hair into a ponytail.





Rebecca smiled as she stood and walked to the woman. For all the walls she had built around herself, she could not be uncaring to these sudden additions to her life. She loved them, ccherished them and most importantly cared deeply for them. It was clear to her that Chelsea needed help, care, love and attention. Whether tender or firm and forceful was an irrelevant issue and would change besed on the situation. But she would accept Chelsea's own happiness over her own.





"What is it?" asked Chelsea, confused as she looked up to see the sudden depth tenderness in the other woman's eyes.





Rebecca said nothing and only smiled as she kissed Chelsea deeply and tenderly, letting all her softness and gentility come through in that one act. When she broke the kiss, Chelsea had to bite her lip to keep from a sob escaping her throat. A hug and a few quick goodbye's later, the two women left.





Ereanis was watching them leave when Richard spoke. "You know, there's something I've been meaning to tell you." said the man as he put on his own jacket and grabbed his keys off the kitchen table. "I used to lead people too, and there are a lot of times I failed. The result was always lethal, or so close it seemed a bit too similar. So I understand your own guilt and loss with more clarity than you might imagine. The thing is, you can't let it eat you up like you once did. You have to remember that those who died, did so willingly and even gladly. To wallow in guilt is an insult to their actions, memories and wishes. Instead, do what they would have wanted. Live, if only for those they left behind. So don't you dare think of dying on us Ereanis," he said, turning away from the table and heading out the door. "I'll never forgive you if you take away so much good from our lives."





Ereanis smiled gently at the sound of the car starting and then pulling away. The man, he chuckled, thinking silently to himself, was a very wise and very bright person. One Ereanis himself might have to take advice from. He shook his head at Richard's distinct act, one not at all submissive, and forceful enough to even be called mildly dominant. That alone told Ereanis that he had meant every word. In that moment and forever after, Ereanis was proud of him. Proud to have known him, to have held him and spent time with him, but most of all, proud to have heard those words from him.





--





Chelsea found the drive relatively quite, but not uncomfortably so. Rebecca was quiet, not intruding and making attempts at small talk just to fill the silence, just nodding and asking directions every once in a while. She felt a bit guilty at being so quiet, as though she should have talked to the woman while she drove but that never lasted, for one glance at Rebecca told Chelsea just how at ease the woman was. Half glad and half sad, completely confused and conflicted, Chelsea appreciated the silence. Her mind was a whirl of emotions&nbsp; and thoughts. How could she in good faith say no to meeting them again? This wasn't some selfless decision she could make for the benefit of her girlfriend and Ereanis, Rebecca and Richard's pleasure. The night had meant too much to her in so many ways. Then again, how could she talk to her girlfriend? She knew that Vanessa would never understand and probably kick her out the minute she found out. Chelsea couldn't not tell her, since that was inacceptable. Her thoughts alternatively depressed her and gladdened her. So, it was that when she was dropped off, Rebecca could see clearly the tears so close to the surface. The panic rising in the other woman was not out of control, but it would soon be there.





"Sweetie," said Rebecca, stepping out of the car and hugging the other woman tightly. "I don't know why you're so scared. To be honest, despite the fact that in the one night together we all feel as though you fit in just right and already we know so much about you, we don't know what you're going home too, other than the fact that it can't be very good if it causes you so much pain and confusion. I just want you to know, no matter what happens, we already care for you and if you ever need anything, please give me a ring." she said softly, kissing Chelsea on the cheek.





Chelsea seemed even closer to tears, but with a nod, a watery smile and a tight hug, she fled upstairs to sort things out for herself.





"Be safe," muttered Rebecca to the air as the woman left and got into her car. What she had said was mostly true. They actually knew a lot about her from Ereanis earlier explanations and conclusions, but they truly did not know what Chelsea had waiting for her. Rebecca was going to have a long day worrying about that one.





Silently, the woman got into the car and headed off to work.





--





"Hello," said Richard as she got out of her car.





"Hello," said a surprised and very relieved Rebecca.





"You look as bad as you feel," said Richard as he enveloped the woman in a hug. It took Rebecca a second to loosen up enough and return the hug more fiercly, before she realised his words seemed a bit discordant.





"What do you mean feel?" she asked with a frown.





"Well, I'm not sure but since a bit now, I've been feeling miserable for some reason. Worried, sad and regretful all at once, and seemingly, for no reason at all." he began, leaning back against his car as he explained. "I thought I might wait for you to see if you'd come, maybe to lighten my mood before I head in I suppose. But the minute you turned into the parking, I felt your mood. It's like we're sharing emotions or something because suddenly everything was worse. I don't know what it is, but I'm sure Ereanis is somehow connected. Anywho, what happened? Chelsea doing that bad?"





"That's odd and I intend to ask him about that." grumbled Rebecca, glad to have something to focus her mild level of anger on so she stopped feeling so worried. Richard's raised eyebrows told her that it seemed to be working and he was indeed sensing her emotions and substituting them for his own somehow - unintentionally too. "Ok well, you're right about the emotions anyway. How come it doesn't work both ways?"





"I don't know." answered Richard, his own brow frowning as he thought it through. "I'll let you know if I figure it out. Chelsea?"





"Oh, yeah, it wasn't all that, but there's definetely something going on we don't know about." answered Rebecca. "She's as wound up as a murderer at his hearing. I don't imagine we did anything that bad, but she was close to panic. I don't think I helped much, but then I don't know why she was so upset." sighed Rebecca and turned towards the office.





"Well, don't worry," comforted Richard and fell into step beside her as they made their way up to the building. "I'm sure things'll sort themselves out."





"I hope so," murmured Rebecca to herself and together, the two entered the building.

Ereanis smiled as he walked down the street. Manchester in October was often cursed. The rain coupled with the cold temperatures left people too warm in thick coats and too cold in light sweaters. Of course, to someone who didn't feel cold or heat in the same way we did, Manchester was lovely. The rain fell, giving the air a clear, crisp feeling, the light breeze only made the leaves chuckle, and the alternate peeks at the sun behind a cover of clouds only added to the allure of the city. Of course, this was only amplified in some of the higher class subrurbs with their lack of traffic and people to add a sense of calmness and serenity about the place. Ereanis liked it. The area through which he now strolled was for the rich and quiet. Massive compounds, surrounded on three sides by walls, open at the back to allow the fortunate the opportunity to explore, walk, picnic or do much of anything else, though today the weather restricted such activities.





Ereanis walked until he reached roughly the center of the entire area. Closing his eyes, he tuned his senses to the presence of people and the aura's they exhuded. It didn't take him long to ascertain a part that seemed to be devoid of human life and seemed to beckon to him. Confused, but trusting in instincts, he headed back the way he had come and frowned at a gate. A small detour helped him find a sitable place to avoid the guard. A quick scan to confirm he had the right place was all he needed before hopping atop the wall. He descended with equal grace and resumed his stroll through the place. It truly was lovely and untouched. A relatively large chalet sat along the bank of a rather large stream, stone steps leading down to the water's edge from the back of the house. A span of the stones curved around a large boulder towards a thick, wide bridge that spanned the considerable girth and depth of the waterway, providing a way across. The chalet itself was relatively large and there were two smaller ones flanking it on either side. Nature had taken over the sides and backs of the houses, but Ereanis suddenly got a clear picture of what they had originally looked like. The stones had hardly changed over the years, and the wood was of a lovely quality and treated to last, though a few beams would need replacements. From the outside they were almost blocky. Each of the smaller one's mirrored the other and were two floors, though he assumed there was a basement. The houses were based on a cube, but had so many nooks and cranny's with balconies and windows, porches and flat roofs sticking out that the whole idea seemed to be - allow as much open air access as possible. The larger was four floors and all three had stairs on either side, stone once more, that curled around in lazy circled to allow entrance to any level from the outside. Ereanis smiled and turned to leave, heading back towards the wall where he had entered and easily leaving. He paused on the way past the gate, the guard lounging in his chair, half asleep and noted the real estate agent's sign on a worn, beaten poster stuck on the gate.





Nodding, to himself, he left. The place would work perfectly. He only needed a few things before he could proceed.





--





Richard and Rebecca spent the day composing resignation letters and then handing them in. The entire process went rather well, and they declined their paychecks, instead begging immediate leave. So, they were home realtively early and wondering where Ereanis was when the phone rang.





"Hello?" asked Rebecca as Richard prepared a light lunch for them.





"Hi," stammered Chelsea.





"Love? Where are you?" asked Rebecca suddenly concerned, the reaction causing Richard to nearly slice his own finger off as he chopped a few vegetables for the roast.





"I'm outside." said Chelsea not knowing where to begin. Things had gone pretty much as expected. She had gotten to the appartment, tidied up whiel she waited and was rather surprised when Vanessa walked in earlier than expected. Halfway while she was confessing to everything that happened, Vanessa had kicked her out, thrown her clothes behind her and locked the door. Her parting words were, "If you really are a whore then I'd rather not be the brothel. Goodluck you dumb bitch." After spending the next half an hour weeping hysterically and nearly choking twice on her misery and panic, while she packed as much of her things as she could, she left and found an empty bus stop and phone booth. It had taken her nearly three hours to come out of her shock to phone Rebecca.





"Where love? I'm coming right now." ordered Rebecca, slipping completely into dominant mode. Her frustration and coldness worked.





"Down the road and to the right from where you dropped me off. There's a bus stop." was all the woman said. Her voice catching and straining, almost hollow.





Richard had heard enough and grabbed the coat and keys, holding them out to Rebecca.





"I'll be there in five minutes," said Rebecca. "Don't move. I'm coming."





"Here," said Richard when the phone was back in its cradle. "I'll get lunch ready. She sounds like she's in shock. Get her back safe," he muttered and smiled softly before shooing Rebecca out the door.





"Thank Richard," muttered Rebecca, grabbing the keys and coat before scurrying to the car. A well of rage seemed to pour out of her and she stifled it before getting in the car and driving off. No point having an accident in her state.





It took less than five minutes to reach Chelsea, despite her words and calmness, driving like the devil herelf and breaking nearly every speed limit on the way.





"Come here," was the only thing she said before hugging Chelsea tightly, the woman dissolving in sea of sobs and shaking uncontrollably in Rebecca's arm. The rage welled up inside her once more and nearly made her growl, but the helpless woman in her arms quickly killed ever emotion and carefully, tenderly, Rebecca led Chelsea back to the car. "Let's go home." she murmured.





"Bags," said Chelsea, trying to pull away and only getting a firmer grip on her arm and being forced into her seat.





"I'll get them. You stay," she commanded and retrieve the two bags and arm load of clothes before getting in beside Chelsea.





The ride passed in relative silence. Chelsea was coming out of her shock, but the entire experience of the last few hours had rocked everything she had known about herself and her life. Last night, she had known that what she had with Vanessa wasn't right or fair. However, knowing something intuitively and having the truth thrown at your face were quiet different. Added to that the fact that Vanessa in all her screaming had shown Chelsea just what she thought of the woman and the fact that she didn't even have a place to stay, everything had seemed to be finished for Chelsea. It had taken her a long time to get over just the berating comments and focus enough to call Rebecca and suddenly, she was aware that the sun was already about to set in a couple of hours and the moon was visible. The entire experience had left her so drained and exhausted that it wasn't surprising that she was quiet and reclusive.





"We're here hun," murmured Rebecca as she got out. Richard had heard the car pull up and was already pulling the blonde woman out of her seat to wrap her in his arms before handing her of to Rebecca so he could empty the car.





"It is alright." said Ereanis, walking up the driveway, his face gentle and soft. Richard didn't question.





"Come," said Ereanis to Chelsea, lifting her up easily and carrying her into the house and to the kitchen. Richard and Rebecca scuttling in behind the man. "Richard, food. Rebecca, a quilt" he commanded, and both, without hesitation, obeyed. Ereanis sat carefully, cradling the woman in his arms and lap as though she were the most delicate babe in the world. Chelsea herself calmed, felt her gut ease through the knot and her chest lighten. A few strokes of his hand had her leaning into him, curling up like a real baby and finally breathing easier. "You do not need to tell me," murmured Ereanis when Richard brought the food, "but eat. There will be a time later for everything else." he assured her before nodding for Richard to feed her. Chelsea did not feel odd, which surprised her. She was a grown woman, in the arms of one man, being fed by the other, while a woman wrapped a quilt around her chilled form, being touched and stroked and cuddled by two of them and she felt not the least bit strange. Instead she felt as though she were recovering from dehydration. She was warm, she felt loved and most of all, she felt at ease.





Rebecca climbed onto Ereanis' other leg easily and began to stroke and hold Chelsea's legs. Wordlessly taking joy in the knowledge of the woman's comfort and resting herself against Ereanis.





"Richard, why don't you take her upstairs and let her sleep?" asked Ereanis when they were done. A nod assured Ereanis and soon the woman was being guided upstairs and tucked into bed, tired but 'at home'.





"We need to talk," stated Ereanis when Richard had come back down. He smiled at Richard's and Rebecca's shared glances at each other before continuing. "A lot has changed in these past few hours. First, I shall choose to show you rather than explain." Ereanis then closed his eyes and concentrated. Nothing happened at first, Richard and Rebecca shared yet another glance and the a deep resonating sense of contentment began to build. It increased steadily until neither of the two wanted anything more than to curl up in bed and sleep. "Now I shall explain," said Ereanis smiling and drawing them back to themselves. "You are both becoming empaths. When anyone spends time and shares a deep bond with me, you will begin to feel emotions. From me and from others who are close to me. It can be turned off and even reversed at times, specially when there is a particular need or correction to be made."





"Earlier," began Richard, "I felt Rebecca, but it got stronger the closer she got. Also, she couldn't feel me." He had already begun to figure out so much during his day, but he wanted to confirm his suspicions before jumping to any conclusions.





"It's simple really. You are submissive to her. So when she is sad, you have a tendency to be sad because of that. Similarly for most other emotions. So whatever she was feeling, you were mirroring. Had they been different, you would each have felt the other and a level of..." Ereanis paused, searching for the right word. "Equality and calmness would have been reached. All emotions do not negate each other, but all emotions are different. Just the change of perspective will help you get a measure of calm and reduce your confusion."





"Alright," said Rebecca. "But you mentioned the effects could be revrsed?"





Ereanis nodded. "It works like anything else. If you are sad or angry, and Richard sends you all his happiness and joy, even if he is in another city, you will begin to feel happy and joyful. Sending it to you is easy. All anyone has to do is be happy, sad, angry or anything else and just think of you whole heartedly while they are in their state. You have to want the other person to share your state or your joy before they begin to feel it however. Normally you would feel the waves of joy from a person, but to actually be happy because of their emotions as though you had just done something to make you smile, takes conscious thought and willingness. That will come with time."





"Ok," shrugged Richard, willing to wait and not really have anything much to add.





"The other thing is Chelsea," went on Ereanis. "She is quickly becoming an empath and that is why she calmed so quickly. I thought it prudent to give her a measure of rest. It bears some thought. Also, she is now homeless, her girlfriend kicked her out." said Ereanis.





The other two already figured out that Ereanis must have read her, but hadn't quite been prepared for that. "Why," nearly growled Rebecca, her calm gone with the level of anger that surfaced. "Why kick her out without letting her pack and not even go to look for her? I understand anger at cheating but this is inexcusable."





"That one is a more clouded person than even I have the ability to understand," sighed Ereanis, his tone calm and resigned. "But that poses another problem, this time, one which I have solved." said a vaguely gleeful Ereanis.





Another shared glance nearly brought a laugh from Ereanis. "There is a house in the West," he went on. "The deed is iny our name," he motioned at Rebecca, "and ready for moving in by tomorrow." His grin was more akin to a little child who had scored all 'A's on his test when everyone complained about how he would fail. It was a shit-eating grin.





"Wha..." stammered Richard, at a total loss for words.





"Well, it took a bit of effort and a lot of energy," Ereanis explained, "but it is done."





"Chelsea's going to be a bit scared and lost," said Rebecca softly thinking through the implications.





"Which brings us to one last matter." nodded Ereanis, all his glee gone. "We will have to wait for her tomorrow, and if she seems ready, explain the situation. I think it prudent before she gets more involved that she realise what it is she wishes or does not wish to get involved in. That will be the time I will show all three of you what we face."





Richard and Rebecca were quiet for a time before sighing and sharing glances yet again. It was a bit to mull over. Rebecca was the first to speak up. "So, did you expect this? And is there anything else you are?"





Ereanis smiled and nodded in his usual soft and enigmatic way. "Yes, I did. But you must understand, this is something that people who have spent months at a stretch with me experience. To have the effects showing in a matter of days both astounds and confuses me. Initially I thought that it was the seriousness of the situation that seems to have heightened my capabilities and the time needed for them to take effect. However, I think it is more than that. Other aspects seem to be remaining the same. Just to verify I did a test earlier and most of everything else I can do is the same. It seems the abnormal speed only extends so far as the both of you as well as Chelsea. I had indeed expected this, but not quite this soon. Which brings me to your seond question," here Ereanis paused to adjust his positing and went on. "You will, all three of you, start getting a sense of rightness and wrongness about everything. It is not good or evil, but more like having a much higher level of intuition. You can tell when someone has had their very nature distorted and perverted. It does not mean that they are evil, but only that they are seeing the world through a different set of eyes than your own, and a perception you might not always agree with. This will manifest itself rather profoundly when it comes to things and places. Since everything you make is of Earth in one way or another, certain things will seem wrong and skewed and some will seem to be no different than before. Other than this I expect nothing. Though I should warn you, the abnormality of the situation does not permit me to make claims of surety. Be prepared and remember who you are. That is all you can do in end." finished Ereanis, getting up.





"Alright," muttered Richard. "Nothing we can do for it but to wait I suppose."





"I think we might as well. It'll probably take some time to get used to all the new side effects. For now, a meal and a bed seem just fine." said Rebecca, motioning Richard to serve them.





Dinner was a quiet affair and it wasn't long before all three found themselves silent and lost in their own thoughts. Richard and Rebecca's thoughts were rather similar, both marvelling at how far they had come in the span of a few days. Yet somehow, they all seemed to have progressed, not at all. The thought did not sit well with them. After all, what would it mean other than that they were either doing all the wrong things or not enough of them. None of the things they had done seemed so wrong or misguided, and hence both came to the conclusion that they had to do more. This though was quickly dashed, leaving both floundering in confusion as another one interceeded. Ereanis seemed to think that the both of them were progressing remarkably fast and had exceeded all his possible expectations and estimations. So then, why were they not progressing? Was it only a matter of perception? Did Ereanis' surprise stem from the fact that in times past, he had always had a lot of time to accomplish his goals? It seemed likely, but then did the swift pace with which Richard and Rebecca were changing indicate that they had to move faster this time? If so was it because of the urgency or importance? Perhaps their own personal leaps were nothing more than an indicator of how well they seemed to fit with Ereanis himself?





As the doubt continued, Ereanis himself found his thoughts uncharacteristically doubtful and worried. However, this did not last. The thought of failure had but entered his mind and just begun to latch onto his psyche when he realised what was going on. He closed his eyes briefly. Chelsea was awake, or drifting on the very edge of consciousness and sleep. It took little energy to calm and comfort her troubled mind and soon she was sound asleep once more. Rebecca and Richard, however seemed not to notice.





"Rebecca, Richard," said Ereani softly and smiled at the two when they looked up.





It wasn't his words, but in fact the lack of them that gave Rebecca her first clue. Something was wrong. A little thinking and it dawned on her that she had long ago given up indecisiveness and doubt. This form of questioning herself was quite abnormal. She frowned and thought, her eyes growing more confused as she recalled that emotions were now shared between all three of them. However, Ereanis had much more control than to let his emotions overwhelm anyone else, and Richard was too decisive and sure footed to doubt himself. He would have asked. Chelsea, screamed her mind suddenly. No, not suddenly, she realised as she suddenly sat up and just as sudenly jerked back from the table to stand. Not suddenly, because she had realised it a while back. How would they survive like this? "Ereanis, we need a plan or something." she stated. Her voice was firm and she was sure she spoke truth, but she also needed to hear a voice and collect herself. The silence was growing a bit much and this was at least a bit scary.





Richard seemed to understand her reasoning and come to the same conclusions though, because even he nodded somberly at Ereanis as he turned away from Rebecca.





"But you already have one." murmured Ereanis, slightly amused at Rebecca and even more so at Richard.





"What?" Rebecca was puzzled once more.





"Well, you do have a back up plan and strategy. Richard is your submissive, should he have looked to you for guidance or had you focused your frustrations and vented them on him, both of you would have realised the truth of the matter. I do not say harm him, but just turning towards each other and seeing the doubt, so very misplaced and odd on the both of you, would have shocked you to realisation." finished Ereanis and sighed.





"Why, why didn't you tell us?" grumbled Rebecca dryly as she sat back down.





"I assumed you would know so much. Remember, a sword that is dropped might very well chope your toes off and kill you just as easily as yur opponents blade." said Ereanis as he resumed eating.





"You mean, if we don't learn how to use this well, it won't help us at all, but hinder us." said Richard matter-of-factly still nodding.





"Indeed," said Ereanis.





"Well, fair enough." muttered Rebecca.





"You must both understand, that because I find energy in emotions," said Ereanis, leaning back in his chair, "those same emotions will be the basis for most of the things that happen around me. You will find your feelings much stronger and hence the effect they have on you will be more than usual as well. Add intimacy into the equation and you two have the ability to withstand much and do even more. However, neglecting and forgetting these emotions and bonds will be your downfall." Ereanis stopped and motioned to both Rebecca and Richard to follow him. He needed to show them exactly what they had and how to manage it, something no amount of words could really accomplish. So then, actions would have to be used. Ereanis motioned for them to form a circle around each other in a relative clear space on the floor of the kitchen and they stood silently. "You two complete each other. Maybe in the sense in which you think, but I do not mean it that way. One is dominant and one is submissive, one is male and one is female, even most of your experiences vary and compliment each other. Connecting all of this is your love for each other, one of the strongest bonds that exist. So, you two need to understand each other and realise just how to act and react when either one of you needs help of any kind."





Rebecca nodded. They couldn't afford such a failure. Ereanis could not be baby sitting them all day and even if he could, she would find it inacceptable. It was true that this might take a bit of time to grasp, but she understood what Ereanis was doing. It was absurd for them to expect so very much from themselves. How on Earth were they supposed to grasp something so alien to their very humanity in a matter of days? Yet they had to do so and with Ereanis guidance, it might very well be possible. Rebecca now understood why Ereanis had asked them to leave their jobs. They would need to spend a lot of time thinking and learning, practicing and perfecting certain abilities, both natural and instilled by the being standing in the kitchen in front of them. Time to hitch up her skirt and get to work, she thought with a chuckle.





"It seems near impossible that we be able to prepare and understand everything about this," said Richard with a frown. It was true. This was a strange occurance in and of itself, but the fact that they were expected to master it soon was stranger still and seemed unlike Ereanis, his usual requests being achievable, albeit other worldly, strange and a bit difficult to your average person with their average hang ups and so on.





"True," said Ereanis. "In fact you can't, simply because you are not limited in anyway. So long as you wish to achieve anything and the goals or means are emotional in nature, it can be done. The vaguer the connection to emotions, the harder the task. Hence, there is no point in understanding it all. The only thing that matters is to know one and another and be able to tell when something is wrong. Your only defense and weapon is your closeness, to yourelves, each other and me."





"Hang on," said Rebecca sharply as she looked at Richard while he nodded. The man's eyes were slit and fists clenched by his sides and the rage seemed to roll out from him in waves. She turned back to Ereanis to see him standing and looking at her. His face was as cold and expressionless as the first time they had met him. But the rage coming off the other man was palpatable and so unlike him. She was sure Ereanis was forcing the emotion on Richard, so sudden and strong was it. Yet, what was his point? To make him angry and prove how vulnerable they were? Her own anger started to respond to Richard's and in that moment everything clicked. He wanted her to solve the problem before she got angry too. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, nearly choking on the rage, forcing it down and calming herself. Once she had gained a level of peace enough to think, she began to think of the most recent and soft emotion she had felt. Warmth and comfort, love and care for all the three people in her house, Chelsea, Ereanis and Richard. It became harder to think as Richard's rage rebelled for a few moments, but it got easier and easier.





"Enough," commanded Ereanis and in that one word, she stopped.





She had not even heard the word clearly, but her sub conscious simply clicked into auto-pilot and shut her down. Rebecca blinked once, then twice and then thrice before shaking the lethargy from her mind to look up into Richard's eyes, his frown bringing her back into herself quicker than she could have expected.





"That is all for today. What you learn is up to the both of you. Remember this - I have full faith and trust you two completely. I do not need to teach either of you." said Ereanis and walked back to the table. He knew they would learn. The small back and forth was fairly obvious and easy to spot, but that they had thought to acknowledge the situation and act said volumes. Most people never did and made up excuses later, saying everything from how they had not intervened because they didn't wish to invade another's privacy to the fact that nothing was even wrong with the other person. Rebecca and Richard would learn and would do so on their own with each others help. Not only would their bond grow stronger but the 'practical' aspect of their trials and errors would leave them with lessons that would not only be remembered for longer and more easily but also applied more often and in a more efficient way.





--





It was dark. Chelsea's eyes snapped open and a wave of confusion descended on her. Why was it dark? Shouldn't there be light? Where was she? Of course, the last question inspired her memory and she fell back against the sheets heavily. She was home. Her brow creased and the frown would have been invisible in the dark room, had anyone been present to see it. Some things needed to be cleared up before she could decide what she should feel or even admit her current ones to herself. A few minutes of stumbling around in the dark and she had the lights turned on. Her sigh was audible when she caught sight of the pile of clothes lying across a chair, her bags intact sitting below. It took effort, but she fought off the sounds and sight of Vanessa valiantly and instead focused all her concentration on the task at hand. Changing, washing up and going to check if the other three were awake. The task proved not too difficult since the guest room had an attached bath and her clothes were already present. Physically ready but mentally in tatters, the woman stepped out of the room and, quite bravely she thought, ventured into the living room.





"Hello there," said Ereanis as Chelsea stepped into the room. Chelsea would have looked lovely had her shoulders not sagged, lips not been caught between her teeth and eyes not filled with anxiety and fear. To Ereanis who caught the emotions as easily as other people caught a scent, the woman was far from presenting her best. This however, meant very little to Ereanis. His only concern now became soothing the woman's soul and assuring her that she had a place and should relax. No easy feat, he chuckled inwardly as he thought to himself, especially not when humans were so loathe to trust one another, let alone the unknown.





"Hi," murmured Chelsea and awkwardly made her way into the room.





"Richard and Rebecca are in the kitchen cleaning up after dinner and should be out in a moment." went on Ereanis, and motioned for Chelsea to sit beside him on the sofa. "Are you feeling any better?" he asked softly once she had sat down.





"Yes, thank you," said Chelsea. Her frown returned as she wondered where to begin.





"It is quite alright," said Ereanis, turning to face the woman more completely. "You have many questions I'm sure, especially some concerning where you stand with us and what you should be doing. Let me answer one first. Whatever you have left behind you when you came back today, it is gone. We do not ask nor need to know. You are always welcome by our side and are already part of the family, so to speak. You simply are avoiding the truth that is already in front of you." he said smiling, turning Chelsea's face up with a finger under her chin.





"He's right," said Rebecca as she walked into the room from the kitchen, Richard trailing behind her, matching his pace to hers. "I understand you've been hurt, but you are being a bit silly if you think we're just about to let you walk out of our lives forever and leave. You can go anywhere you want and do anything you wish. Just remember that we care for you and so you'll always have a place with us." Rebecca settled down on the opposite end of the couch, mirroring Ereanis, and turned to face Chelsea. Even she could feel the anxiety from the woman.





"Chelsea," said Richard, his voice drawing the woman's eyes to him, kneeling at Rebecca's feet and taking of his Mistresses shoes. "If you go we'll miss you. You're free to do so, but remember that we really want you to be happy and none of this is a facade. If you do choose to leave, you will be missed beyond whatever you expect." Shoes off, he put them aside and began to massage Rebecca's feet.





"I think you will need more information before making a decision." said Ereanis and stood. He knew the girl was already anxious, but unlike Richard and Rebecca, he could tell the source. It would have startled everyone, just as surely as it startled Chelsea. She would be miserable if they had seemed as though they would only keep her for a short period of time. Knowing that there was genuine warmth and compassion had alleviated a lot of her worries and this is what startled her. She wanted to stay. None of them had expected it, least of all herself, but she knew it. She would miss them a lot if she had to leave. So, Ereanis thought it perfectly logical to show her just what she would be missing so much.





Chelsea did not have much time to ponder her new found feelings. Ereanis had stood and in that movement let go of all his control. Shrugging his coat off he stood and turned towards Chelsea, his eyes aglow in a green so deep she could drown in them. All too suddenly, she found herself aware of his appearance. Not sexually, though she nearly always was aware of him so. Aware of him as though she had finally truly noticed him. Everything, from the long locks of brown hair to the sheer size of the man. For the first time she noticed that he somehow seemed to dwarf Richard even though he was not that much taller than the man and didn't have the others body mass. For the first time she noticed that his skin had a slight glow, like oil-slicked, tanned skin and there were grooves in the skin. No, not grooves, Chelsea thought as she fought to swallow past the lump in her throat and the pounding of her heart, but carvings. The stretched from his jaw line down his neck and disappeared under the remainder of his clothes.





Richard and Rebecca were awestruck as always whenever they saw just what and who Ereanis was. The past few days they had taken it for granted, largely because of the comfort level the three shared. Today, though, they were once more aware of the being in his entirety, standing in a living room. He looked as out of place as a pack of lions in the workplace. Both found breathing a task and heat rush through them warming even their cold toes.





Ereanis read their emotions and once sure that there was no fear here he let go that last bit.





Chelsea needed to serve him. No, she realised, she wanted to serve him with all her heart. Why should she not? She was his, totally and completely, to do as he wished. And oh, how so very gladly she would. His words jerked her back into herself.





"I am not human or even mortal. I am humanity's last resort, the royal guardian. I serve only to help when all else fails." said Ereanis. He did not want her judgement too clouded. That would defeat the purpose. So, instead of letting her submit to him quite yet, he held off.





Chelsea heard him, clearer than she should have perhaps. She did not know nor cared right now. She was only aware that suddenly she could think and her questions were being answered. The fact that he had not suggested she do anything, but neither turned cold, spoke volumes to the woman who was used to being ordered or ignored. Ereanis was explaining himself to her, she who deserved no such explanation in her mind, but yet he was doing just that. No, she thought, she was being allowed to maintain her control. If he so desired, he could have drowned her in her own submission. Yet, he wasn't.





"There are some things you should know, both about myself and the reason I am here now," he began. The minutes rolled on by as Ereanis explained everything to the woman, helped in parts by Rebecca and Richard. Chelsea, much to her credit, never once did fear touch her mind. After the initial shock of seeing Ereanis in his entirety, runes and unnatural power - all of it, she was not surprised much by anything else. In fact, after a distinct lack of shock or surprise she began to make guesses and questions of her own.





--





The night wind howled and a star blinked out in the night sky. Suddenly, it flared again and pulsed for a few seconds before maintaining a steady twinkle.





"So, we move in over the weekend." said Rebecca coming to stand beside Ereanis as he stood on the balcony.





"Yes," murmured Ereanis, taking the woman into his arms.





"You know," sighed Rebecca as she rested against his chest, "most people would freak out and run screaming to the hills if they ever found out just what you are. We run around fighting to be the biggest fish in the pond, but in the end, the sight, sound or even thought of a true power terrifies us. Governments have only succeeded by courting the people and any show of massive strength has only served to be disastrous for us. But yet, here are three people who trust you and will gladly walk into the pits of hell beside you, after knowing you for only a matter of days, no ordinary task in itself."





A mild chuckle answered her. "I am a part of nature. You run from an avalanche but not a tree. It is only a question of perception Rebecca. But I shall agree with your assessment of people. It took me decades to undersand it. You are wise as you are beautiful, as usual." murmured Ereanis.





Later that night, when everyone lay in a tangle of bodies, lost to sleep, Ereanis stood once more under the open night sky, listening to words no one would ever have heard. Words spoken by the world itself in the form of the stillness in the air, readiness and tension in the very ground.





"And so, it begins."









THE BURNING BLADE



By Whisper







CHAPTER 5 - GLIMPSES OF A FOE





Ereanis stood off to one side and watched the others wander into the house with wide eyes. When they had been driving to the area, their curiosity had been piqued. It took Ereanis a long time trying to explain that he had not done anything shady to gain ownership of the place. After all, how on Earth had he got them such a pristine area of land? Ironically, it was that very statement, verbalised by Richard that had drawn comprehension on all their faces. It was rather lovely to have the very Earth on your side.





Now, as the three walked through the house, occasionally stepping into view of Ereanis by wandering out onto a balcony, roof or wandering around close to a large window, he felt happy. It had taken Ereanis considerable effort to clear away and perfect the houses. To most people it would have seemed to have taken too short a time, but to most people, Ereanis could not exist. The thought brought a chuckle from Ereanis. The overgrown vines and trainers were now more humble, creeping up a few select walls and pillars, windows had been removed and instead wooden blinds had formed, thick and heavy, held together by rope that no knife could truly cut. The overgrown weeds had vanished to be replaced by soft grass and the three chalets were now connected not by dirt paths, but by stones. Not polished, man shaped ones, but more akin to natural outcroppings from hills, rough and solid, weathered and worn with dirt, age and rains come and gone.





Rebecca marvelled at the interior. There was not a speck of dust despite the distinct lack of windows and every single piece of furniture, from the table in the foyer, the wardrobes in the bedrooms, the bed and even the kitchen, with its counters, cupboard, shelves and chairs, were all natural, being made from different types of woods. Somehow, every aspect of the house seemed alive and she had little doubt that the other houses would indeed be the same. There was vibrancy to the stillness of the room that seemed to resonate with emotions and breath that was so very... Ereanis, thought Rebecca with a chuckle.





"He's done it all," noted Richard as he walked into the bedroom and towards Rebecca.





"Mm-hmm," was all the reply he got from Rebecca, who still had a vague smile on her face.





"But when?" asked Chelsea. "From what I can tell he couldn't have had more than a day or at the most, two, to put it all together. Yet, here it is. And somehow, I don't think you're to be finding this wood anywhere." she finished.





"It is of the Earth," murmured Rebecca as she smiled. It was true, she realised. The very house felt like a glade at night with a full moon, right out of the story books... 'Alive' was the only word you could really use to describe it.





Ereanis watched the three troop out of the house and towards the car, where he now leaned and grinned at them.





"It's lovely," murmured Rebecca coming up and hugging Ereanis tightly.





"The other two are much the same." he said wrapping his arms around the woman. "For now, there is one last thing we need to do." he said more firmly, letting Rebecca go and turning to walk forward, motioning for the others to follow. They walked along the side of the large central chalet, coming out at the back and making their way down the stone steps and off the side onto the bridge. A short walk brought them to the other side of the river and into the midst of a wooded and still naturally wild area. None of them were tired and only mildly puzzled when Ereanis motioned for them to stop.





"I have not yet shown to you what we are fighting. I think the time is now ripe to let you know." he said, turning to look at each of them in turn. "I have no guide for you, no safety reel, no map... nothing. The only thing you need to remember is who you are and that none of you are alone." he said and motioned for them to come forward. Once they surrounded him, he closed his eyes and focused. Pain tore through his mind and for a second the world faded into an orange haze of pain and torture that seemed everlasting. He fought hard to hold the brunt within himself, but some leaked out and touched the other three, causing each of them to shiver, shudder, shake and groan. Then he opened his eyes. They were not in the woods anymore, or even in the country, thought Rebecca. The ground stretched on unevenly in all directions, the only landmarks being dead trees and bushes. The sense of pain and despair filled the land, thick and heavier than any mist that could be. Then they saw something that they had not expected - a person. His eyes had sunk in, his skin looked like paper and even to a casual observer, there was something wrong with the man. His teeth had rotted and fallen away, hair hung in random tufts on his forehead and his fingernails were burnt to crisps. But what scared Rebecca, Richard and Chelsea the most, was the look in his eyes. He was no longer human. They watched as the man skulked across the land, bobbing and dipping behind small hills and outcroppings of rock. Their gaze flitted across the place until they saw what the man hunted - yet another man, in a worse condition.





"This is what has become of a place that has ceased to exist in your history books," said Ereanis, his voice sounding solid and reassuring. 



Suddenly, they were gone and standing back in the woods. Rebecca was the first to find herself moving. She bent over and gasped for breath, the feel of the place clinging to her skin and oozing down her throat. She needed to breathe air that was clean and clear. She did not notice the first of the tears trail down her cheeks until Ereanis lifted her face and wiped it away. Her gaze moved to Chelsea who was hurling her breakfast while Richard had collapsed onto his knees against a tree and wept openly.





"This is something that must be healed," said Ereanis softly, drawing her attention back to him. "Be strong," he said softly, closed his eyes and pushed the remainders of his energy into the other three, and together, himself and Rebecca, touching and holding the other two, found their way back to the house. They moved in silence, Ereanis walking in front with Richard supported easily against his shoulder and Chelsea and Rebecca following, leaning on each other as much as supporting each other. Over the bridge, and through a back door, the four found themselves in the kitchen of the central chalet. Light streamed in through the veranda from which they entered and Ereanis opened up a few blinds to add to the brightness. None of the other three felt much like speaking and instead sat gingerly on the stools around the island that sat opposite the sink and platforms along the wall.





"That is not natural." said Ereanis softly, walking towards the veranda and drinking in the sunlight. "It is something that had been created artificially." he continued, shaking his head before turning back to the three within the shade of the room. "There is a lot to be done and now you know as much as I."





"Where was it?" asked Rebecca first.





"The one you saw was somewhere in what you now call Russia. There are two others, one worse and the other not quite that bad yet. The former is in South America and the latter on a chain of islands just off the coast of South Asia." replied Ereanis.





"Well, do you know what exactly is wrong with them?" asked Richard frowning.





"No, no more than you do." answered Ereanis with a sigh, signalling for them all to follow him back outside through the door and they began a walk along the stream, easy and relaxed, mulling over the information they had already.





"All right, I suppose first we need to find out what that was." said Rebecca softly. Her voice grew in confidence as she went on. "I mean, it could be a lot of things and we might as well try to understand what it is. I suppose after we get a hint of some sort we can decide our next step."





"No," murmured Chelsea, "we're not ready yet. We have none of the things we'd need to figure it out. No money, no credibility, no knowledge base... we'd be doing solely on Ereanis' word and I doubt anyone would listen to us with that story anyway." she sighed. "We'll probably have to do most of it ourselves and we need to be better equipped for that." muttered Chelsea.





The walk continued a bit further and the group once more fell silent. What Chelsea had said was right. To go to any sort of official body would invite questions. Questions that they couldn't quite answer or that would ruin what little credibility they had.





Ereanis smiled and stopped them all suddenly. "We have time and trust me; anyone trying to wander too close to any of those areas will not be leaving anytime soon. The cause I do not know, but those beings used to be human. Primarily, this means thinking and feeling before acting. What you saw earlier were beings that did not feel or think and operated on impulse and instinct. To do this," he went on as he shrugged off his coat and stepped into the stream, "We need more than resources. We need strength and power. The Earth has turned upon itself in the area's I've mentioned and only when the internal struggle is complete will anyone be allowed to venture into those areas. Until then, they will be inaccessible to anyone and anything." he finished, turning and diving under the surface of the stream, coming up glistening and clean.





"So basically, we can't do anything?" asked Richard in a perplexed voice.





"Of course we can and we must. We must become more secure, aware, powerful and much more. But for now and today, no, we need not do a thing. I will however ask you to forget it for now and join me. It seems pointless to drive yourselves mad with worry when there is little to be done at this moment." he said. The three standing by the stream gave each other perplexed glances.





"The water must be frigid." complained Rebecca.





A chuckle that quickly turned into a full throated laugh told her that her concern was duly noted and dismissed. "Why not change that then?" asked Ereanis with a mischievous glint in his eye.





It took Rebecca a second to understand that he meant that quite literally. Richard as well seemed to suddenly frown and loose himself in thought.





"Chelsea can do it already," murmured Ereanis softly, the teasing gone, replaced by a level of surprise.





Rebecca and Richard would have been mildly offended, or at the very least, put down, had they not sensed Ereanis confusion and surprise. Chelsea on the other hand had the 'who-me?' look of a guilty child, caught with their hand in the cookie jar. She'd been putting together how Richard and Rebecca might have done just that when she felt something. She hadn't been quite sure what it was, only that whatever it was, it had resonated through her. Just as when Ereanis had first revealed himself to her.





Richard frowned harder and Rebecca turned to gaze at Chelsea as silence fell, disturbed only by the chuckle of the stream.





Ereanis followed her thoughts and smiled to himself. Chelsea had not only managed to figure out just how this would work but had identified her place as well. "Chelsea," he said standing up in the water, "heat the water so we may swim."





Chelsea shook visibly. Richard and Rebecca understood that wrapped in those words was more than just a command, but also a sense of ritual. They watched the words affect Chelsea, pulling her slave to the surface until the woman was dripping wet, flushed with arousal and barely able to concentrate.





Chelsea however, knew exactly what was happening. The moment Ereanis had stood, she had felt it. A sense of breath, the feeling of a heartbeat... everything around her, the trees, the ground, the rocks, the water... everything was alive. Alive in a way that was as starkly different from birds and bees as it was from a car. She could have asked for anything at that time, rain, snow, sunshine, fruits, an entire home, anything at all and she would have gotten it. The mere thought confounded her senses. Thankfully, with Ereanis standing in the water, chest bared, nipples hard from the cold, skin shining with drops of water that decorated his body like small miniature liquid diamonds and hair hanging like ropes of the glossiest wood, her thoughts immediately focused. When she heard her name from those lips, it was something else and when one arm rose, almost pleadingly she could not resist. She understood now, completely, how to make the stream hot. Dropping to her knees, her breath rushing out of her, she began to stretch herself forward. Under normal circumstances, the very lack of speed would have made the entire act seem impossible. Yet, it seemed rush to all four of them in that instant. Her arms went forward and ever so slowly her head bowed until she leaned forward, spreading her knees wider so that she could extend herself for her Master. Oh god, how she wanted to serve him. How desperate was her need to heat the water for him! She put all her thoughts and actions, all her lust and desire, her frustration at the seemingly impossible task, everything she had into herself and held herself in that position for him. Her breathing deepened and she felt the moan leave her lips, dragged out of her, torn even, until she shivered in her need within the confines of her position.





Richard felt it first. A shifting that started somewhere deep, deep down. Then he saw the small tendrils of steam curl up around Ereanis and even he nearly fell to his knees at the sight of Ereanis, eye more vibrant than ever and skin hidden and revealed by wisps of steam, his hair trailing drops of water down the man's chest and back.





"Rise," said Ereanis, his voice deep and heavy, like a heavy weight thrown into a vat of syrup, it pulled Chelsea out of her daze. Her arousal remained, and it seemed, was higher than ever before, and so too, it seemed was her sensitivity to not only the area around her, but her own body as well. She could feel the jeans she had worn for the day, rub their thick and coarse, yet somehow soft material against her thighs and calves. She could feel the grass under her feet and the way it tickled the places between her toes and held her arms on the ground where they lay before her, palms up. The satin of her bra rubbed her nipples and the cotton of her shirt rubbed across her shoulders, stomach and back.





Rebecca watched the woman raise her head. She understood from the tone alone that Ereanis hadn't wanted Chelsea to stand but only raise her face and it seemed Chelsea understood that as well, for that is all she did. Straining her neck upwards, her cheeks flushed she moaned as she watched Ereanis step forward and rise higher in the stream. Rebecca watched Richard who seemed similarly affected, the man's breathing laboured and his eyes open a bit too wide. She could feel the waves of lust pouring forth from the two and began to wonder why. Ereanis next actions told her why.





"Your power, each of yours will manifest itself most easily in certain ways that define who you are, as a sexual being, an individual, a soul, a fighter..." he said softly as he stood before Chelsea, water trailing down the curve of his back in graceful running droplets. His back bowed over and arced beautifully as he reached down to take hold of Chelsea's wrists and lift them up until the petite woman was kneeling up, her hands straight in the air and lips parted as she gasped for breath. "I respond to such with my own characteristics. What are you now?" he asked of Chelsea.





Chelsea couldn't believe the level of arousal shooting through her mind. Her answer came without her thinking about it and it seemed so right to her in that moment, she didn't question it at all. "A slave," she murmured softly.





Richard groaned and dropped to his knees, and suddenly even Rebecca felt lust pound her body in a barrage that she could not withstand.





"And who am I to your slave?" asked Ereanis, ignoring the other two.





"Master," whispered Chelsea.





Richard felt his word explode and he nearly swooned and fell. He wanted to serve. His need rose so quickly and suddenly that it shook him to a measure of calm. A measure that lasted only as long as it took his dilated pupils to move lazily from Ereanis to Rebecca. Rebecca was in full dominant mode and the moment Richard met her eyes, he began to crawl towards Rebecca.





Rebecca felt aroused, much more than she had moments ago but she could still think. However, it was obvious, even to her, that neither Chelsea nor Richard were capable of that right now. She frowned as she sorted it through. To raise power from the Earth to heat the stream, Chelsea had brought forth her submissive side. Ereanis had simply responded and turned from Ereanis their friend and loved one to Ereanis the Master. Yet why was Richard so affected?





"You misunderstand because you are top," said Ereanis turning to her, one hand easily holding the shivering Chelsea helpless on her knees and gasping for breath. "You must maintain a level of composure even when your slave will beg you for something he cannot take. This is what it means to dominate. This is also your own belief. If it was not, you would be in no better shape than they."





Rebecca's attention was dragged back to Richard kneeling before her, head down, arms outstretched and waiting for her to turn her attention to him. Lust shot through her again at the sight. Fine, she thought to herself, if we're going to play, let's play well. She turned back to Ereanis and began to walk around Richard to the side then lowered herself to across his back. She felt the groan escape his throat more than heard it and knew she had made the right decision. "So," she said turning back to Ereanis, "you're saying Richard is having the same effect to me as Chelsea is to you? But that makes no sense. Why would he?"





Ereanis smiled softly and lifted Chelsea up onto her feet. Then, turning his gaze from Rebecca, he took each of Chelsea's hands in his own and pulled them behind her back. Holding them in place with one hand, he grasped the woman's top and bra with the other and effortlessly ripped them off, drawing a gasp from her throat.





Rebecca suddenly felt lust pour over her skin and sinking into her. Suddenly she knew what was happening. She was throwing out her own lust, something basic and carnal that Richard in his submission could not resist and was feeling it through every fiber of his being. "I see..." she murmured to herself as Richard trembled underneath her.





Ereanis turned slowly and, maintaining his grip on Chelsea's wrists that were trapped behind her back, pulled the girl around to face Rebecca. "Not yet," he said and stepped behind the girl, and bent his head towards her ear and began to whisper into it.





Rebecca suddenly felt exactly what Ereanis was trying to get her to feel. Chelsea in her actions had appealed to the Earth in the only way she knew how. In the most human and basic of desires - lust. The base need to hump like bunnies and reproduce. She had got her desire of a heated stream but had been left seething in arousal and the sight of Ereanis had shot her into over drive, along with the power of her wish being granted. Ereanis had not been the only one who seemed to be thrumming with energy. She could feel it too. The reason that both she and Ereanis were affected was because Chelsea's sexuality had a very strong flavour of submissiveness to it and the only two dominants around responded in kind to her lust. Of course, her arousal had affected Richard and thus the man now knelt humbly under her, begging to be used by his Mistress and Master while Chelsea, who was now having her jeans jerked down very firmly and roughly by Ereanis, was moaning in ecstacy.





"Now you see," sighed Ereanis as he let go of Chelsea suddenly. The woman could not stand and with her ankles halfway down her knees, fell to her knees instantly, not unlike a toy whose strings had been cut. A few steadying breaths was all the kneeling woman needed before she turned and faced her Master.





"A slave begs permission to undress her Master," she said in a breathy voice. Chelsea was out of breath and had to sruggle to keep from stammering several times. It wasn't that she was ashamed or frightened at all. Arousal poured through every pore of her skin, leaving her heated, burning and aflame, needing and begging with her body and her words to serve. Her throat was only constricted by her need to get enough breath into her lungs.





Ereanis already knew her state and had expected it when he had commanded her to heat the stream. Yet he knew just what would drive the woman into a frenzy and only gave her a nod as response before turning back to Rebecca while Chelsea whimpering to cover a moan moved and began to open his wet pants. "We can do much, and so we are responsible for much. Even standing by and doing nothing is an act and can be one which you regret." he said, completely ignoring the woman who knelt before him and struggled to roll down the wet pants without causing her Master any undue distress.





Rebecca surpressed a chuckle as she watched Chelsea's state go from aroused to something that could most closely be described as a frenzy of lust, need, arousal, submission and desire. Chelsea would be heading into sub space in a few minutes, she thought silently to herself silently before considering Ereanis words. He was right. Because of the nature of relationships with each other and the closeness of those relationships a lot of their strength would come from closeness, if today was any indicator. Standing by and fastidiously being dim witted about the changes that seemed to be manifesting would be an error she didn't think she'd be able to live with in good conscience. "You're right. Richard dear," she said standing and turning around, her hand flashing out to grab her slave's hair and lift his head up, pulling it back painfully, "I'm hungry." Her tone was dominant and the man took a sufficiently short amount of time to realise what exactly she wanted that Rebecca turned to Ereanis and smiled that soft, tender and proud smile she was coming to associate quickly with Richard.





Richard had been following the conversation and some of the visuals from the corner of his eye. However, it took him a moment to swim up from his own descent into subspace. Being used as a stool for his Mistress while being ignored totally in all other aspects was a practice he had never tried before but loved already. An employee of the government getting turned on by objectifcation?! Who would have thouht? Rebecca let his head go and Richard stayed still a moment pondering on how he could accomplish the task. Thinking wouldn't really work and some genuine desire was needed. He smiled at his silliness and stopped thinking. Instead he sat back on his heels and began a practice he had begun over a decade ago and enjoyed tremendously. Closing his eyes, he thought of Rebecca's living room. Then with his eyes clothes, he placed his hands on each knee and began to concentrate on his breathing, feeling each breath as intimately as though there wasn't else in the world. Satisfied that he had all his concentration, he imagined the center table piled with fruits, the smell of fresh grapes, oranges, melons and pumpkins, herbs and leafy greens. His thoughts began to fill with desire, in particular, the desire to serve his Mistress, to get food for her to feed her, to please her in anyway she wanted right now. He let the desire grow until his heart began to ache with the need to feed her and serve her.





Ereanis eyebrows raised and Chelsea let out a moan and went limp, her eyes shut tight as waves and waves of desire hit her. So strong was Richard's desire to serve Rebecca that it poured through the slave leaving her on the verge of orgasm and half crazed with need. Guttural moans and whimeprs escaped her lips as she tried in vain to move, to beg Ereanis to let her serve him.





Then it happened. The trees behind the trio began to blossom and flowers sprang out, fruits began to pop up everywhere. Bunches of grapes hung from a vine that had mysteriously appeared, winding around a tree. Watermelons spotted the ground metres from where the four stood, the occasionaly yellow pumpkin peeking up from the greenery. The smell of basil and bay leaves surrounded them as trees quite literally sprouted and grew from the ground feet from them.





Richard opened his eyes and Rebecca saw the love in them. Without a word, without hesitation at all, she leaned forward and kisses her slave, slowly, tenderly and deeply, letting him feel her satisfaction with his mouth. "Stand," she breathed into his mouth and moved back to allow him to do just that. Rebecca did not waste a moment and before he had stood, stepped into Richard and kissed him full and hard on his lips. "I'm proud of you slave. You've served me well." she murmured and turned around.





"Thank you Mistress," breathed Richard. Normally words of that nature would have made him happy but this time they sent him shooting into subspace as Rebecca's satisfaction literally sent a shiver of joy up his spine.





"Strip me and let's test the water," she commanded, slipping back into her role as Mistress effortlessly, her voice firm.





Ereanis only chuckled and lifted the limp and shivering Chelsea, carrying her into the stream to show her handiwork first hand. "You should be proud of yourself," he said softly and kissed her softly.





Chelsea was genuinely surprised, for despite knowing she had heated the stream, she had not expected such a warmth during this part of the year. Human sensibilities were left shattered as she couldn't help but acknowledge that the water was as warm as on a hot summer afternoon. Ereanis kiss however ensured her moment of sensibilities were short lived and soon she was back to whimpering and moaning, her lust no longer held back by him. She was barely aware as Ereanis waded to a rock near the bank, and didn't even notice Rebecca who had ordered Richard to strip as she made her own way into the water and towards Ereanis.





Rebecca had seen Chelsea squirming and had an inspirational idea. She knew Chelsea loved a lot things but most of all, she loved pleasing. She loved to serve and be of use to her Master and Mistress. Of course there was another desire that Chelsea never quite knew what to make of that would be just perfect for the moment.





Ereanis knew exactly what Rebecca had planned and only chuckled at the ease with which the ideas seemed to flow from the woman. Being a more than happy and willing participant, Ereanis put the slave on her own feet so that Rebecca could step in front of the woman and sandwich her with Ereanis pressed against her from behind.





Chelsea bit her lip but couldn't stop the moan from escaping her lips as she realised she was pressed between her Master and Mistress. She knew she was theirs and the idea of having their undivided attention made her knees weak. A second moan, louder and more filled with need, escaped her as Rebecca's thigh slipped between her legs and began to grind into her while her fingers found her nipples and began to pinch and tug on them harshly. The moan lasted for barely a second, all of the time that it took Ereanis to press himself against her bottom and slide along the crease of her cheeks. A gasp severed the moan for not only had Ereanis positioned himself so well but his hands had effortlessly ecaptured hers and she found them now held behind her, tighter than she could have managed on her own, pulling and straining her body, forcing her to thrust her nipples out for Rebecca.





"Such a wet slave... I can feel you despite all the water," whispered Rebecca, leaning forward to bite the woman's ear and tug on it. Chelsea's only response was to shudder and begin to pant for breath.





"Richard, come here," commanded Ereanis noticing the man was just taking off the last of his clothes.





Richard had been watching and felt a pang of lust tighten his belly at the tone Ereanis had used. "Yes Master," he said and scurried towards the bank.





"Oh god please... please Master, please Mistress..." gasped Chelsea. Her breathing was off, her heart pounded in her chest and she couldn't think or reason. Totally unaware of Richard at this point, she found herself so very conflicted. She wanted to serve and being teased by two so very capable dominants was driving her beyond the sane boundaries of lust. She was on the verge of orgasm and did not yet have enough control to stop herself.





Ereanis knew her state and adjusted his grip on her wrists so he could pull her head back and force her arms lower, arching her back further still. "Does the slave beg for an orgasm?" he asked softly and bit her hard on her neck. Chelsea was forced in that instant to use the last of her control to keep from cumming, and when her eyes slit open and she saw Richard suddenly, at least to her, standing beside Ereanis she knew that the two holding her could have forced her to cum over and over and then punished her mercilessly for her slip. The thought sent a shiver of anticipation and fear, as well as happiness through her. She wanted them to do just that, but she did not want to fail them either.





"Come her slave," called Rebecca and pulled Richard behind her and reaching between her own legs to stroke and pull him closer to her.





Richard was soaring in orbit. He had alreayd been incredibly aroused but the touch of his Mistress and the feeling of being pressed against her back drove him into sub space with the force and speed of a nail being hammered through plywood. The groan that escaped his lips was quickly followed by a whimper as Rebecca squeezed hard on the head of his cock and pulled him as close as he could go, letting him feel her own heat over his shaft.





Ereanis smiled at Rebecca. Rebecca had no idea what he had planned but the glint she caught in his eyes was indeed real and not imagined. His smile widening, Ereanis slipped the tip of his cock into Chelsea, drawing a half scream from her throat. The orgasm was so close and Chelsea would indeed have come if Rebecca had not suddenly pulled firmly on her nipples, forcing her breasts straight out and causing pain to ease her orgasm but only leave her in a worse state.





Stepping out from between Richard and Chelsea, she slipped behind Richard and pressed herself to his back. A slight push and his cock was now pressed firmly up against Chelsea's clitoris. A shared glance and smiles that grew in length was all the hint that Rebecca and Ereanis needed from each other. Ereanis pushed himself all the way into Chelsea, his hands holding her hips in place and his inhuman strength allowing him to thrust fast and hard even in the water to hammer into the woman. Richard in the meanwhile found himself gasping and moaning, his knees weak and head thrown back as Rebecca's fingers entered his bottom and forced him harder against Chelsea. With one cock in her, hands trapped between her own back and Ereanis and the feel of Richard's cock grinding against her clit, sliding up and down against her in the water, Chelsea came. Screaming, writhing and bucking, water splashing everywhere, her orgasm tore through her with the two men riding it. Rebecca pushed Richard forward and back with her fingers thrusting and twisting inside his bottom in time to Ereanis own strokes.





Over and over they made her cum, forcing her through at least four orgasms, each one hitting her before the other died down and eventually she was only supported by Ereanis hands on her hips, her legs having long given way. Richard however had not been made to cum yet and so was debatably in a better or worse state than Chelsea.





"I think we'd better get her out of the water," chuckled Rebecca as she slipped her fingers out from Richard's bottom, leaving the man gasping and fighting to stay on his shaky legs.





"I agree," said Ereanis and without altering his grip and showing no extra effort, he lifted Chelsea over his shoulder and carried her from the stream as easily as though she were a wet rag. Rebecca and Richard followed close behind. Once a suitable distance from the stream and closer to the surrounding greenery, Ereanis lifted Chelsea off his shoulder and cradled the recovering woman in his arms. Closing his eyes, he took a deep breath and concetrated, only for a moment, and then sighed. "Here should be fine," he said, settling down on the ground, the woman cradled in his lap. "Richard," he said, turning to the man, "there should be an abandon bee hive a few yards from here. Get it for us," he commanded as a surprised Rebecca settled down beside him.





"Yes Master," said Richard and trotted off away from the stream and into the brush. He thought about it for a second and nearly instantly knew where the hive was. It didn't take too long and soon he had found the hive, picked it up and was heading back to Ereanis.





Rebecca settled down and began stroking Chelsea's head where it nuzzled his chest, her eyes half closed and her breathing telling them she was returning to consciousness. Richard hadn't gone far but Rebecca knew just where he was and she knew that if she concentrated she could be by his side, not physically but in other ways instantly. Perhaps it was just a side effect of their exertions, or maybe yet another manifestation of Ereanis' presence. She pondered it while Richard returned.





"Rebecca," said Ereanis, drawing her attention to himself and out from her musings, "why don't you fetch that rock so we can keep the hive on it?" he asked mildly, turning to gaze at a piece of granite jutting out from the ground a few feet away.





"Sure," said Rebecca frowning in confusion. It seemed, she thought to herself silently as she got up and headed to the piece of stone, that today was a day of revelations. She shut the thought down before her mood darkened and began to wonder why Ereanis had asked her to fetch the rock and why this particular one. The rock was right in front of her now and squarish. It stuck straight out of the ground and was slim. Rebecca thought it seemed to be a part of a larger rock under the ground. Without really thinking about it she reached down and gave a testing tug. When there was no give at all, even when she applied more force and nearly slipped to fall on her bottom, she knew her first guess was right. She looked back and frowned at Ereanis, wondering what his purpose was in sending her here. A small nod from the man told her that he had known that the rock wouldn't be quite that easy to pull out and wanted just this one. Confused and wanting to figure out the mystery she frowned harder and stared at the rock. Somehow, she doubted physics was involved in this particular lesson and short of that she had no other ideas. A sigh escaped her lips as she sat down cross legged and tried to concentrate enough to will the stone out. This, however, only served to make her feel a bit foolish and silly as well as frustrate her some more. Finally, wanting the rock out and growling in frustration, she leaned forward while she sat and gave it a kick. Still the rock refused to budge. Now considerably angry and wanting to get the stone out of the ground even more, she stood, bent over and gave it a sharp tug. Strangely, the rock popped out fairly easily, leaving her sitting on her bottom with a relatively large piece of stone in her hands.





"Ereanis told me to tell you, you don't know your own strengths anymore," said Richard, startling her as he approached her from behind. "I agreed but I think now I see what he meant and can understand his little laugh." he continued and smiled at Rebecca.





"I don't get it," said Rebecca, turning to face him. "It was lodged in and it broke?" she said in confusion as she stared at the jagged and darker edge of the stone where it had clearly been broken off from the main lump of stone. Maybe she wasn't a geologist but she knew from the feel of the rock on the first few tries that taking it out would definetely have involved digging.





"It's simple Mistress," said Richard, dropping to his knees and offering Rebecca the hive, which wasn't as light as it looked since for some strange reason it was still filled with honey. "You don't know your own strengths anymore." he said chuckling and took the stone to the stream to wash it while Rebecca went back to sit beside Ereanis and a kneeling Chelsea.





"I hope Richard shared my sentiments?" asked Ereanis innocently as Chelsea waited at his feet.





"Yes." said Rebecca sitting down beside him. "What exactly happened?" she asked, still in confusion.





"well," said Ereanis, turning to her, "you wanted it bad enough and so you retrieved the stone. How this will work I don't know but ever since Chelsea here very smartly heated the stream and Richard obtained food, including the hive you now hold, I was beginning to wonder whether or not you realised you yourself had this lovely ability yet." he said chuckling. "I see you do," he said softly.





Rebecca mulled it over in silence and they waited until Richard returned with the stone. Ereanis was right. Both Chelsea and Richard, as submissive and slave wanted something very badly and the Earth had catered. So it seemed she had indeed the same ability though if Ereanis' words were a hint, the manifestation would depend on circumstances and situations. The hive set on the stone, Ereanis broke a piece off and began to feed some of the honey to Chelsea.





She had never quite tasted anything like it before. It hadn't the sweet, head spinning sugary taste of normal honey. In fact it was unlike any honey that existed. It had a spicy, smoky texture and was far more filling. It tasted like cinnamon, yet at the same time like rosemary... In fact, Chelsea realised, it constantly changed its taste. The thought forced a squeal from her throat and moans and yelps from Richard and Rebecca.





"This honey is true honey," explained Ereanis as he fed Chelsea. "Long before the world changed, bees existed and this was what their honey tasted like."





The four of them spent the next few minutes in silence pondering the logic of it, if there was any, and finally resigned themselves to just enjoy it. Not surprisingly it also seemed to be a lot more energising than anything Rebecca, Richard or Chelsea had ever had. This didn't last long.





Rebecca, who was being fed by Richard decided she wanted an additionaly flavor she wanted that seemed to be missing and what Mistress wanted Mistress got. A hand pushed Richard onto his back and her hand scooped some honey over the prone man's torso. Slowly and savouring her actions, she began to lick it away, one tiny lick at a time. This of course drew moans and gasps from Richard who had not quite gone soft. However, she did not stop nor heed his protests at all. Once having cleaned Richard's torso of honey, she scooped some more and spread it across his belly and sides, taking her time once more to lick him clean. Short quick flicks of her tongue and long, slow, lazy drags ensured that the prone man stayed well aware of just what she was doing.





Ereanis saw Rebecca's actions and decided to add fuel to the fire. One hand slipped into Chelsea's hair and gripped it as he rose. With no great care, he dragged her to kneel above Richard's head. "If you want more, lick," he said calmly to Chelsea, pushing her face down towards Richards body and then letting her go. Next, he moved away scooped up some more honey and slathered it liberally over Chelsea's mons. "You too slave," he said looking at Richard. A sharp smack on Chelsea's bottom ensured that she kept herself just high enough for Richard to reach if the man strained enough. Pausing, he surveyed the activities and decided that perhaps something else was needed. Ereanis smiled as an idea came to him and walked off towards a branch of a small tree he had spied earlier. Not too thin nor thick, still young and smooth, he broke off a branch,&nbsp; and returned to Chelsea. He ensured it was sutiably splinter free and not too rough by running his hand along the length of the branch. It was indeed blemish free enough that, satisfied, he walked back behind Chelsea.





Rebecca had watched the above and after Chelsea had been positioned she had began to slather Richard's shaft and testicles with the honey and was busily eating her fill. She paid no heed to the man's whimpers and moans of pleasure, only concentrating on her own task. She began by teasingly licking and sucking along his thighs, letting her teeth dig in at just the right time to keep Richard on his metaphoric toes, leaving red impressions behind whenever she had nibbled enough and moved higher. The effect this was having on Richard was rather vocally proven, with moans, groans, whimpers and the ocassional incoherent begging of, "Oh please Mistress..." What he was begging for, even Richard did not know. Chelsea, diligently nibbling and sucking on his nipples, licking his stomach, sternum and belly button was definetely not helping and the Richard found himself in a position of conflict. He wanted to be used this way but the teasing touches were getting to him. He desperately needed to cum, as was attested by his cock twitching and throbbing, spasming whenever a set of teeth bit into him. Finally, Rebecca decided to end the man's begging and shut him up. She did not quite have a gag but found an equally effective means by grabbing Chelsea's head and pulling the girl forward and over Richard's honey coated cock while she herself diligently went to work on his testicles. It worked. Richard stopped begging and only moaned and whimpered on ocassion, using all his concentration to keep from cumming in the next few seconds. Neither was overly gentle, since both knew that Richard loved it. They sucked, nipped, nibbled, licked and teased the man mercilessly, driving him into a shivering submissive frenzy. Now, Rebecca watched Ereanis return with the sapling from the corner of her eye. She knew what was coming and sat up, placing herself firmly over Richard's cock, not letting him enter her but instead forcing him up against his own stomach and letting him rest between her open pussy lips. She knew the effect this would have on her already aroused and helpless slave and relished each twitch and throb of his cock, nestled between her folds. Each time he throbbed, Rebecca writhed over him, twitching and squeezing juices over him, which in turn sent him into another twitching, throbbing frenzy. Chelsea in the meantime found herself gasping for breath and already open and dripping at the sight of Ereanis. Rebecca's hand kept her head pressed down and held her until Ereanis grabbed the girl's hair.





"You never did get permission to cum did you slave?" whispered Ereanis into Chelsea's ear once he had positioned himself behind her.





"No Master," she moaned as the sapling slide in light, teasing circles over her lower lips.





"Well, if you want to cum so badly, let's see how much you can cum like this," said Ereanis matter of factly, his free arm flashing out and landing hard on Chelsea's bottom with a resounding smacking sound.





"Oh!" yelped Chelsea. The sight of the switch and the teasing touch had not prepared her for the unexpected spanking at all. Heat from her blood rushing to the area quickly flushed her pale bottom.





"Richard, stop eating," ordered Ereanis and punctuated the end of the sentence with another slap of his hand.





Richard couldbarely reply and only groaned. Rebecca had heard the first slap, and shivering in lust had began to grind herself on his trapped shaft. Her fingers gripped Chelsea's nipples and held the woman down, forcing her bottom higher. Wanting to further inflame the aroused girl, Rebecca commanded Chelsea, "Lick his head."





"Yes Mistress!" moaned the girl, leaning forward further and raising her ass inadvertently higher as she licked hungrily over Richard's cock, tasting not only his pre-cum on the head but Mistresses juices and honey as well. The taste shot her into orgasm as Ereanis next slap landed squarely on her pussy - a little more gentle but still firm - and the sapling whipped across her bottom in his other hand, the combination only driving her wilder.





"Don't you dare cum slave," said Ereanis to Richard as he began to stroke Chelsea's ass in quick succession once her orgasm died down, pushing her to the edge of pain and pleasure again, quickly, with a few well placed strikes. The sight of Chelsea's bottom flushed red with darker streaks of the switch marking her rear only served to inflame Richard further. How he wished they would work him over. However, following orders was something he did well and Ereanis' words had been a very clear order. He would not disobey.





Richard watched flashes but did not grasp the effectiveness of Ereanis' work. Beaing able to read Chelsea's thoughts, Ereanis focused his strikes in the least expected places and ensured that Chelsea remained on guard, ocassionally letting the sapling swish its way onto the moist and open folds of her pussy. One such strike pushed her off the edge and three more consecutive strikes in quick procession made sure she came twice again. However, Ereanis was far from done.





Rebecca let go of Chelsea's nipples and let the girl recover from her orgasms while she herself began to rotate and grin herself harder and faster on Richard as her own orgasm built. She saw Ereanis slip behind the dazed woman and knew he had entered her when Chelsea's head flashed up, eyes wide and a scream tore through her as yet another orgasm rattled her bones. Ereanis felt her tightness, the squeeze of her muscles around him, massaging and milking his cock as her orgasm ran through her. He, however, did not stop and wait inside her while she climaxed. using his hands to hold her wrists and asking Rebecca to hold her head by her hair, he slammed into the woman's opening repeatedly. The first thrust pushed Chelsea's orgasm higher, the second, higher still. Soon, she was leaking fluids all over Ereanis and Richard as she was held fast by the two strong and capable dominants, being forced to endure a seemingly never ending cum. When the intensity of her climax decreased, Ereanis only chuckled and altered the angle of his thrusts, ensuring he hit her g-spot on each stroke. Chelsea found that while she was still having nearly constant miniature climaxes now, she could think, albeit briefly and for moments at a time.





"She did not tell you to stop licking little slut," whispered Ereanis in Chelsea's ear and suddenly Rebecca's hand forced her head down to Richard's cock. Ereanis knew the woman needed a reprieve and chose that moment to pull out of her folds and sink his shaft between Richard's open and gasping lips. He hungrily sucked on the cock and worshipped Ereanis orally as the man slid in and out of his mouth a few times, not being too forceful or fast. Once assured that the man was aware enough to be sucking and licking frantically at the cock in his mouth, Ereanis began to increase the speed and force of his thrusts. Wihin moments the gagging and moaning Richard found he had to fight for breath as Ereanis thrust deep into his throat over and over. The thought of being used, and he was indeed being used, by both Ereanis and Rebecca had sent Richard immediately into subspace and his moan would have been closer to a scream had Ereanis not been gaggin him with his cock.





Rebecca could not take it anymore. Her own opening was opening and closing, squeezing tight and opening wide, aching with the need for something inside her. She slid forward and grabbing Chelsea's hair, jerked the girl's head backwards. A hand holding Richard's cock steady, she slid down the length and moaned long and loud. She was tight, tight enough to pull Richard's foreskin painfully back as his shaft entered her. She came instantly, her control over her body lost as she writhed and arched back, grinding harder on the cock buried inside her. "Lick," she commanded Chelsea once she whad finished and let the woman's head go.





"Yes Mistress," gasped a weak Chelsea and quickly proceeded to lave at her Mistresses clitoris. Ereanis chose that moment to pull out of Richard's mouth and pressed his length up between Chelsea's bottom and lubed the girls opening with a combination of Richard's saliva and Chelsea's own juices, eliciting a moan from the woman as she licked hungrily at Rebecca's clit. This of course caused Rebecca to tighten considerably around Richard's girth and squeeze him tight, which of course caused the prone man to shiver helplessly. "Lick her," Ereanis commanded the man and with one hand, pushed Chelsea's bottom lower so that Richard could get at the open folds of her pussy. This caused the woman to moan yet again and begin to pant and gasp for breath against Rebecca's pussy, which once more, caused Rebecca to tighten and Richard lapped with more vigour at Chelsea's pussy. Ereanis waited and contented himself with teasing Chelsea's opening as the three drove each other closer and closer to orgasm.





Soon, Chelsea's bottom was ready and the woman sufficiently aroused. Ereanis did not waste time and altered his grip, pushing Chelsea's arms up behind her back, folding them carefully and firmly and then holding them there as he rose and repositioned the tip of his cock at the entrance to Chelsea's ass. It took one firm push to enter the now well lubed and slightly more open hole and another to push himself all the way inside her. Chelsea could only scream as yet another orgasm crashed through her, but left her feeling far from tired. Her juices squirted out once more all over Richard's face.





Rebecca felt the cock buried deep inside her spasm and throb then, and leaned back, slipping two fingers into Richard's bottom. Only then did she begin to move on him, slowly, in time to her fingers, rising up and falling on the shaft. A sigh escaped her as the head of Richard's cock stroked her g-spot on each time she rose and fell. Her moans were louder still and she began to twist her hips in a circle, rotating herself so he brushed it more often, tightening and squeezing him each time he did, milking his cock hungrily. With Chelsea's tongue laving her clitoris and Richard's cock buried deep in her, her own fingers guiding his throbs and twitches with thrusts, twists and flicks, she watched Ereanis smile at her, and increased the pace. It didn't take long for his new rhythm to take effect and he soon had Chelsea begging, moaning and screaming against Rebecca's clit as he pounded himself in and out of her bottom, starting new fires in the girl and pushing her to the verge of a different series and type of climax. "Cum for me slut, cum for us," whispered Ereanis in her ear, leaning forward. He punctuated the order by biting hard into the woman's neck and increasing his pace even more. In and out he thundered, the sound of flesh slapping flesh and her already sore an red bottom getting another, different type of assault as he pushed her over he edge. Richard knew just how much trouble he was in when Chelsea screamed and juices squirted over his face, again, and again, and then again, for after that Ereanis pulled out of her and rolled her carefully and gently off Richard, leaving her lying limply beside the man before moving around and kneeling between Richard's legs, behind Rebecca.





"Shall we treat him?" whispered Ereanis into Rebecca's ear.





Rebecca was on the verge of her third orgasm and she could only nod and moan.





Ereanis needed no further hint and slid into Richard's bottom, Rebecca's fingers having already opened him enough, dripping and coated with Chelsea's fluids. He needed no more lube and Richard seemed to concur as his cock spasmed deep inside Rebecca, sending the woman into orgasm instantly.





With the remnants of her working mind, Rebecca gave Richard her permission to cum, forcing a breathy and lust filled, "Thank you Mistress," from the man. This was very wise since Ereanis soon began to slide deeper into Richard which once more sent him spasming inside Rebecca and that threw another orgasm over Rebecca before the last was over. Ereanis forced the last of himself into Richard and Rebecca came a third time, screaming and gasping for breath, shaking, shuddering, bucking and grinding helplessly on Richard's cock. Richard was no better and had he not heard the words at the start, he would have cum regardless now. His could not stop cumming and each contraction of his prostate seemed to suck Ereanis deeper inside him. His vision began to waver and he moaned helplessly as Ereanis buried himself deep inside his ass.





"Not yet," whispered Ereanis evilly into her ear before she collapsed and slipped a hand around her waist. Effortlessly finding her clitoris and massaging it slowly, he slid out and shoved into Richard's bottom again, and Richard reflexively thrust himself into Rebecca, screaming as he spurted again. Yet again Rebecca screamed and came, squirting noisily all around Richard's cock. Satisfied that Richard had adjusted to his girth, Ereanis began to thrust in and out of him at an easy, steady pace and kept the man hard. He started slowly and held Rebecca steady as he gently teased her clit and brought her back to full arousal again. Then he slowly began to incerease the pace. Rebecca felt it and reached down to grab Richard's nipples and give them sharp tugs and pulls, ocassionally leaning down to bite and lick them as her hips rode him in time to Ereanis' thrusts. "Not-yet-slave!" gasped Rebecca between thrusts as she held off her orgasms and let them build, biting harder on Richard's nipples to make sure he didn't cum. She could feel Ereanis' thrusts forcing Richard to twitch and spasm inside her and knew it was only a matter of time before none of them would be able to hold on. Still, determined to push them all, she leaned back. Ereanis was still massaging her clit and sending bolts of pleasure through her body, and she grabbed her own breasts, teasing the nipples and pulling them, cupping both and giving Richard a good show. The effect was immediate and she felt the warning spasm of an imminent orgasm from the cock buried inside her. One hand quickly slipped around and gave his testicles a squeeze, killing the orgasm but not the lust and the build up. Again she lneaned forward and began to bite and nibble, lick and suck on his nipples until he was close. Finally, after many minutes and some serious begging from Richard, she reached her own limit.





"Cum for me slave, show me how much you enjoy a cock up your ass," leaning forward, she whispered into his ear.





The words and the sheer submissiveness they implied hit every one of his slave-buttons. Richard's orgasm was so intense that his hips rose, even with Ereanis pushing into him, and weighed down by Rebecca, they rose. Each stroke of Ereanis sent him into spasms and both his and Rebecca's orgasm seemed to drag on for minutes. Finally, Ereanis let go and released his own seed deep inside Richard, hissing as the he climaxed. The feel of Ereanis cum spurting deep and hot inside him, made Richard groan and whimper in lust and helplessness. The three bucked one final time and collapsed, barely conscious.





Smiling sofly and tenderly, Ereanis pulled out of Richard. It took quite a bit of effort to stand and gaze down at the two gasping and three unconscious forms before he settled down beside them and sighed. He watched the three most dear people to him, emanating contentment and satisfaction, the kind that only a lot of sex with someone whom you truly love and enjoy can produce, and he felt complete. Ironically, he had not fed the entire time, but somehow felt energized none the less. Filing the thought away for another time, he lay back and smiled. Rebecca had said he was home at last, and he had believed it, but it had and always would surprise him delightfully each time he gazed upon them and found something new to love about them. Now as he lay watching the three forms, he knew that perhaps someone else would have been able to fulfill him, but he also knew that this was something he would not trade for anything in the world. Love was rare, but to Ereanis, who had lost his own home, his people, his world... home was rarer still and that is what they had now.





There would be a lot to do on the morrow and the coming week was about to be filled with activity. But for tonight, just for tonight, they would not worry or think about anything other than their pleasure. The vikings celebrated before they set sail for this same reason. There would always be calm before a storm. The storm that was coming would be rough and soon much would be needing doing. But for now, there was nothing but the four of them.





Dusk was already falling and the sun would be setting soon, he realized as he enjoyed the moment. But perhaps, in a land so often 'evolving' and changing shape, this dusk would be more reminiscent of times past and not yet another promise of things to come. Perhaps he was simply growing old, he thought to himself with a wry grin, as the popular saying goes. Though, to be honest, having lived for millnia, he was beginning to doubt he'd qualify as 'old'.
