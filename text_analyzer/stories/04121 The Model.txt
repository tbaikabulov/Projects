THE MODEL

&nbsp;

Chapter one � A modelling assignment

&nbsp;

�What time is your next show?� My girlfriend here would really love to be
your model, wouldn�t you honey?�� Amy
nodded, not wanting to make him angry with her.�
�We have been walking around, looking at all the displays and exhibits,
and this seems to be the best one here.�
Do you think we could do a deal or something?�

&nbsp;

Paul looked at the couple standing before
him.� The man was quite tall, with dirty,
blonde hair that fell into his eyes.� The
girl looked tiny beside him, her head barely reaching his shoulder.� She had long, dark hair and from what he
could see, she had a very pretty face. Paul was not sure why, but there was
something not quite right about the couple. 

&nbsp;

�Well, my next show won�t be until 3pm,
which means I have some time to see if your girlfriend would be suitable.� He
moved his gaze to the girl, needing to hear from her if she was as keen to
participate as a model as her boyfriend was. �Have you had any experience in
bondage?�� He saw her look briefly at her
boyfriend, before answering him.� �I have
had some experience, Sir.�� She had
barely looked at him as she spoke, dropping her eyes back down to the ground as
she finished speaking.

&nbsp;

Considering if she would be a good model,
Paul looked over her body. What he saw pleased him.� She was slim, but with a figure that showed
firm breasts and slightly flaring hips.�
�Ok, well I suppose we could make it a lesson for beginners.� It is good to show an audience how to do some
simple ties.� Yes, I think we can arrange
something. What is your name dear?�� 

&nbsp;

He saw her about to answer, but instead her
boyfriend spoke first.� �Her name is Amy.
Hey, thanks so much for agreeing to use her as your model. I can�t wait to see
her up there, all tied up.� So what
happens now, do we come back at a certain time or what?�

&nbsp;

Simone was watching the couple talking to
Paul from the door to the dressing room. She has just had a shower after being
Paul�s model for the scene he had just finished.� She had been about to speak to him, when she
noticed the couple. She couldn�t help but be aware of the way the man held the
girl�s arm in a protective manner nor the way the girl kept her head down,
except to raise it briefly to say something to Paul.� She could sense a certain unease about the
girl, but she supposed that she could just be a new comer to bondage.� The room with all it different stalls and
displays filled with a variety of sex and bondage items, would certainly be
daunting to someone new to the scene.�
She saw Paul walking towards her; the couple still standing where he had
been speaking to them.

&nbsp;

She thought about how less than thirty
minutes ago, he had had her in complete agony.�
She had been his model for his last show and because he knew she was
tough and really loved bondage, he had pushed her hard.� After his general introduction and safety
talk, he had begun to bind her, telling the audience that they should not try
what he was doing at home unless they were experienced in bondage.� That was one thing she loved about Paul, the
way she knew she was safe no matter how extreme his treatment of her was.� By the time he was done, she felt like a
pretzel, her elbows touching, her back arched, her head pulled back by her hair
and her wrists tied to her ankles. To add to her torment, he had put clamps
with weights attached on her nipples and used one of his biggest ball gags to
fill her mouth. She knew that he wouldn�t keep her in bondage like this for
long, but still she had felt every minute while she was in it.� The only relief she had was when he had used
his magic wand to give her a much need orgasm, the pain fading while it buzzed
away at her clit. Of course, when she did cum, he had continued to keep the
vibrator on her, turning the feeling into one of pain as her now sensitive clit
throbbed.� He forced her to another
orgasm before removing the vibrator.� He
had continued to talk to the audience all the time, telling them how she would
be feeling throughout the scene.� 

&nbsp;

He then proceeded to tie her in a number of
different ways, including one where her hands where tied behind her back and
then forced up, making her bend at the waist. A spreader bar tied between her
ankles made sure that her legs remained spread. This is a good position to be
in if you wanted to spank or whip your sub, he told the audience, and he then
showed them how to use various paddles and canes, again stressing the safety
aspects.� By the time he was finished,
her bottom was stinging.� He ended the
session with a question time, patiently answering all questions for at least
ten minutes. During this time, she was held against him as he fingered her
pussy and used his hand to block her mouth and nose, controlling her
breathing.� He had let her answer one or
two questions, but she had found this quite hard as she was on the verge of cumming at the time. He was certainly very good at what he
did and she counted herself lucky that she had found such a good partner to
work with.� Her thoughts were interrupted
as she saw him walk towards her. 

&nbsp;

�Hey love, how are you feeling?�� Paul looked at her, loving the way her blue
eyes shone.� He moved down, her face
arching up towards his, as their lips met in a kiss. �I�m fine, who are the
couple?�� �He wants his girl to be my
next model. I don�t think she has much experience but that could make it
interesting.� I really need to speak to
her alone, though, to make sure she really wants to do it.� I know we were due to go and have some lunch,
but I just feel that I would like to find out some more before the afternoon
show. Do you mind?�� 

&nbsp;

Simone smiled and reached up to touch his
face.� �Of course not.� I can understand why you want to make sure
everything is ok. I was watching them as you were talking and I was thinking
that there is something not quite right between them.� Could be she is just new to all this, but you
don�t want her freaking out on stage either.��
Seeing him smile back, she took in his warm, brown eyes. Though he was
not strikingly handsome, he had that boy next-door look that seemed to belie
his nature.� She knew that many people
found it hard to believe the change that occurred when he was in Dom mode. He
went from a friendly, caring man to one that was definitely in charge. Not that
he didn�t treat his partners with respect, but he knew how to push a girl�s
limits in way that she had not found with many other dominants. He was always
professional and was known as one of the best in the business, which was why
she knew he needed the time to assess the girl before he used her as a model.

&nbsp;

Amy stood nervously, watching the man talk
to the stunning girl. He had said that he just needed to see if he could change
some plans before he could say yes for certain. She had just watched him tie
the same woman up in some extremely tight ties, some which she was sure she
could not handle. She knew, though, that she had no choice in the matter.� Kyle had decided that he wanted her to do
this and she knew that once he made his mind up, there was no changing it.� She just hoped that by saying that he would
use simple ties, he would not tie her the same way as he had the other
woman.� She saw him walk back, Kyle�s arm
tightening slightly on her elbow. 

&nbsp;

�Yes, I think we can do this. Now, I will
need to have Amy on her own until show time.�
To give you something to do while you wait, take this card and show it
to the security man over by the door. It will give you access to some special
displays that only certain people are allowed to see.�� He handed the man the red card that would
allow him special access, betting that this would convince him to leave his
girlfriend behind for a while.� By the
look on the man�s face, he was right. His initial concerned look had changed to
one of excitement.� �Wow, thanks! I
always thought that there was more to these events that what the public gets to
see.� I will be back in time to see the
show.� 

&nbsp;

Amy didn�t know what to think about this
turn of events.� On one hand, she was
pleased she would get to spend some time away from Kyle but she was also
nervous of what she would have to do. She started as she felt Kyle lean down to
her ear. �Now, you will be a good girl, won�t you?� I would hate to have to punish you when we
get home.�� She could still feel his hot
breath on her ear, as he shook the other man�s hand and walked off in the direction
of the security guard.� Not knowing what
to do, she stood and waited.� 

&nbsp;

Simone saw the girl�s uncertainly and came
up to take her hand.� �Here dear, you
just come and sit down for a while. Can I get you a drink or maybe something to
eat?� I am just going to make some lunch
for us both and would be happy to make you something too.�� The girl�s nervousness was obvious as she led
her into the dressing room and sat her down on a comfortable couch.� Paul had come into the room too and she saw
her look up at him anxiously as he closed the door. The girl looked back at her
briefly, before looking down at her hands again. �No thank you, I just
ate.� I wouldn�t mind a drink of water
though, if that is ok.� Simone felt sorry for her, she sounded so scared.� 

&nbsp;

Paul observed the two women talking, taking
in Amy�s body language.� She was very
nervous, her hands twisting together in her lap.� When he saw Simone move to the small
kitchenette in the corner, he made his way over to the seat opposite the couch
where Amy was sitting.� �Amy, are you
ok?� You seem very nervous. You know that
you do not have to do anything you don�t want to do, don�t you?� Simone will do the next show if you want to
change your mind.�� He was surprised by
the look of panic in her eyes and the way her voice shook slightly as she
spoke. 

&nbsp;

�No, please, I will do a good job, I
promise Sir. Please don�t change your mind.� Amy felt panicked by the thought
that he might change his mind, not wanting to face Kyle if she failed in this
task.� She could see the surprised look
on the man�s face, knowing that she would have to be careful in what she said
to him. �Please Amy, call me Paul. I am sure that you will do a good job; I was
just concerned that you were regretting your decision.�� 

&nbsp;

�Thank you Sir, I mean Paul.� I really do want to do this.�� Simone heard her reply, still feeling that
something was not right. While she handed Amy her drink, she caught Paul�s eye
and moved back into the kitchenette, Paul walking behind her. �Do you believe
her?� Do you really think she wants to do
this?�� She saw him consider her
question, frowning slightly. �I�m not sure yet, she certainly got very upset
when I suggested that you could take her place.�
I will talk to her soon and see if I can find out something about her
history.� Meanwhile, how is lunch coming
along?�

&nbsp;

For the next ten minutes, Paul and Simone
ate lunch and talked to Amy about general things like the weather and local
news.� Amy seemed to relax a bit and even
managed to make eye contact with them a few times.� However, once Simone moved to wash up, Paul
could see the tension come back to her again.�
Sitting back down on the seat near her, he knew that he had to work out
how to make her more relaxed before the show. �Now Amy, I need to ask you a few
questions and then I have to check how flexible you are.� I will need to check your pain level
too.� Is that ok?�� 

&nbsp;

Her heart thumping at what he said, Amy
nodded.� �Ok then, first some simple
questions.� You said before that you have
had some bondage experience. Can you tell me what kind of bondage it was?�� Images flashed through her mind of the many
times Kyle had tied her up over the last few months. �I am not sure, S� I mean
Paul.� I know that I have not been tied
as tightly as you tied Simone earlier.�
You won�t want to do the same thing to me, will you?�� She knew she was sounding panicky again, but
couldn�t make her voice any calmer. 

&nbsp;

�No love, I would never tie a newcomer to
bondage like I would Simone.� I have
known her for many years and know she is very tough.� I was thinking more about things like showing
how to do some basic breast bondage and maybe a simple hogtie. Have you had a
gag in before?�� �Yes, I have had some
experience with gags, though I don�t like them too much, but if that is what
you want to do, then that is fine.�� She
knew she was babbling, but she always did that when she was nervous. 

&nbsp;

�Before the last few months, she had never even
seen a gag, let alone had one in her mouth. She thought about the first time
Kyle had used one on her.� She was being
punished for something, she couldn�t even remember what any more. He had almost
pulled her down the stairs to the basement, making her stand under a chain with
cuffs hanging from the ceiling. Reaching up, he had secured her hands in the
cuffs, forcing her onto her toes.� He had
then looped a rope around her waist, pulling the end of the rope between her
legs and spreading her pussy lips to make sure the rope was sitting around her
clit. He had then proceeded to tie the rope off around her waist at her
back.� She had never felt anything like
it and found that she was in agony within seconds.� 

&nbsp;

To finish of, he had waved a big, red ball
gag in front of her face.� She remembered
how she had looked at it, wondering what he was going to do with it.� When he had told her to open her mouth, she
had just stared at him, not believing that he would actually put it in her
mouth.� Kyle had taken her stare as a
refusal, gripping her cheeks and squeezing hard. This caused her lips to open
and he had begun to push the ball into her mouth.�� She had been forced to open her mouth wider
as he pushed, Kyle gradually pushing the ball behind her teeth, before
strapping it tightly in her mouth.� 

&nbsp;

The ache in her jaw rivalled the ache in
her pussy, her toes also beginning to ache too. After five minutes she was
ready to promise him anything, by ten she was.�
Even through the gag he seemed to know what she was saying, so when she
started to say what she would do if he let her down, he kept her begging until she
offered him her ass.� She had never had
anal sex before, but knew that if it would make him let her down, she would let
him have her ass.� 

&nbsp;

When he was buried in her bottom five
minutes later, she was not so sure that she had made a good exchange. She felt
like her bottom was on fire and he had not even begun to move yet.� Despite using lubrication, she was still very
tight and he was very big.� What followed
was ten minutes of the worst pain she had ever felt, as he began to move faster
and harder within her. She was sure that she was going to pass out, almost
wishing she could so she wouldn�t have to feel the pain anymore.� When he finally came, she had felt so
dirty.� He had even made her clean his
cock, making her retch at the taste.�� 

&nbsp;

�Amy, are you still with me?� You drifted off for a while there�� 

&nbsp;

�Sorry, did you say something S..Paul.�� Amy forced
herself to focus on where she was.� �I
was just asking if you would stand up.� She stood nervously, wondering if he
would want her to remove her clothes. When he simply asked her to turn around,
she couldn�t help but let out a sigh of relief.�
She felt him gently grip her elbows and pull her arms behind her back,
testing to see how flexible she was.� She
gasped slightly as he made her elbows touch, feeling the pull in her shoulders.


&nbsp;

�Not too bad, have you ever had your elbows
tied together?�� He had let her arms go
and turned her around to face him as he asked her the question, the focus on
his face surprising her. �Yes, but it really hurt.�� She was not sure why, but she felt she could
be honest with him.� With Kyle, she
always felt that she had to keep things like that to herself.� 

&nbsp;

Watching from the kitchenette, Simone could
hear the conversation going on between the two.�
She was worried about Amy. Though she was doing as Paul asked, there was
a certain wariness about her.� Certain
that it was more then just nerves, she moved into the main part of the room to
talk to Paul.� As she entered, she could
see Paul moving Amy into different positions.�
�Paul, could I talk to you for a moment?�� 

&nbsp;

Sitting back down on the couch, Amy felt a
sense of dread.� She could see Paul and
Simone talking but could not hear what they were saying.� Feeling certain they were going to say she
was not suitable, she felt herself begin to tremble.� Oh god, what would she do if they wouldn�t
let her be part of the show?� Kyle had
told her she would be punished if she let him down and she hated his punishments.
She had to think of a way of convincing them. She froze as the couple
approached her, already convinced that they were going to reject her.

&nbsp;

Paul had listened as Simone had spoken to
him about her concerns about Amy.� He had
to agree that Amy was very nervous, but he still thought that she would be
ok.� It was as they were heading back
into the room, when he saw how pale Amy had gone.� As he got closer, he could see her freeze,
the look in her eyes one of pure terror.�
�Amy, what is wrong?��

Chapter two � A Secret Revealed

&nbsp;

Her heart felt it was going to burst out of
her chest.� Amy tried to focus on what
the two were saying, but could only hear the sound of her heart thumping.� The hands on her shoulder made her yelp, her
fear making her forget where she was. �Please, don�t hurt me, I�ll be
good.�� The feel of something cool on her
forehead made her calm down enough to remember where she was.� 

&nbsp;

Reaching out to touch her hair, Paul could
feel her calm down a bit as Simone continued to rub the cloth on her neck.� He didn�t know what had set of her panic
attack but he knew he had to change his mind about using her as a model.� He just couldn�t risk her loosing it like she
had just done in the middle of the show. �Amy, no one is going to hurt you.
Just take some deep breaths to calm down. That�s it.� Simone, would you get a glass of water
please?� He waited until Simone had left to talk to Amy. 

&nbsp;

�Amy, I need for you to tell me what is
going on and I need you to do it now!��
The firm voice made Amy look up at Paul.�
She had not heard him use that tone before and it was one that she knew
meant business. �I ..I am sorry Sir, I�m not sure.�� She knew that he was not satisfied with her
answer, when she felt him grip her hair.�
It was not painful but let her know that he was serious.� �Amy, I want to help you, but unless you tell
me the truth, I can�t.�� At that, Amy
found her resolve failing her and before she knew it, she was crying.� The hand in her hair was removed and she felt
him pull her into his arms.� She did not
know how long she had cried for but Simone was back sitting on the couch beside
her. �Amy, love, please let us help you.�
I have been worried about you since I met you earlier. Please tell us
what is bothering you�� 

&nbsp;

How could she tell them?� What would happen if she just told them the
truth?� These thoughts ran around Amy�s
head as she tried to work out what to do. �Amy, you know that I can�t consider
letting you be my model if I don�t know what is going on.� I just couldn�t take the risk of you breaking
down on stage.� People will think I was
making you so something against your will.��
At this comment, Amy felt her stomach lurch. She felt herself start to
shake again, only thinking of what Kyle would do.� �Please, I have to do this. I won�t let you
down, I promise!�� 

&nbsp;

The fear in her eyes took Simone by
surprise.� She didn�t think she was
scared of her or Paul, but she was definitely scared of something. �Amy, what
are you so scared of? You know you are safe here.� Simone could see that Amy
was on the verge of telling them, but that something was holding her back.
�Paul, do you think I could speak to Amy on my own for a moment?� She saw Paul
nod and move away to make a phone call.�
Once he was gone, she moved to sit closer to Amy, putting her arm around
her shoulder.

&nbsp;

The feel of Simone�s arm around her was
almost too much for Amy. �Love, please let me help you? Trust me, I promise I
will do my best to make you feel better.� Amy knew she had to risk letting her
know a little bit of what was worrying her. �Simone, you have to make Paul
change his mind.� Kyle will punish me if
I don�t do the show.�� She could feel the
other woman looking at her, trying to work out what to say. �Amy, what do you
mean he will punish you? Is he forcing you to do this?�� Knowing that she had said too much already,
Amy tried to play down what she had said.�
�No, what makes you think that? I just meant that he would be
disappointed if things didn�t work out.��


&nbsp;

Paul had just put down the phone, having
checked that Kyle was being kept busy.�
He had heard Simone ask Amy if she thought she would be punished and
started to get an idea about what was really going on. The way Kyle had done
all the talking and 

Amy�s nervousness seemed to make
sense.� He didn�t know what their
relationship was but it certainly wasn�t an equal one.� Even the way she was trying to lessen what
she had said to Simone told him that she was scared of Kyle.� �Amy, tell me why you are so scared of
Kyle.�� He could tell by the look on her
face that his suspicion was correct.� 

&nbsp;

Amy could not think of what to say. How did
he know? �What.. what makes you think that?��
Even to her own ears she sounded unconvincing. �Come on Amy, you are so
scared of him that you are willing to do something that I don�t think you want
to do. I am right, aren�t I?� She knew there was no way she could continue to
lie. 

&nbsp;

�Yes, you are right, this is not my
choice.�� She watched as Paul moved to
sit down opposite her again, knowing that he would not let it go. �That is not
what I said.� I want to know why he
scares you so much.�� The look he gave
her was one that she could not look away from, his dominant side on show. 

&nbsp;

�I .. He..oh god,
it is such a mess.� I did something
really stupid and Kyle found out and has been blackmailing me for the last few
months.� He decided this morning that it
would be fun to have me on display in front of an audience and he threatened to
punish me if I didn�t do a good job.��
Amy felt a momentary feeling of relief at telling someone her secret but
then the reality settled in. She still had to convince them to let her model or
she would be in trouble anyway.� �Please,
you can see why I have to be your model.�
Please don�t let him punish me again, please!� 

&nbsp;

Looking at the girl, tears running down her
face again, Simone knew they had to do something. �Paul, what can we do?� You know that using her as a model wouldn�t
be right, but we can�t just let her go back to him and be punished.�� The look on his face was one she knew
well.� It was one of deep thought and he
wore it often when he was considering how to tie or torment her next.� She also knew that it usually meant that he
would come up with some good solutions to whatever problem he was trying to
solve.� 

&nbsp;

While was thinking, there was a knock on
the door. He saw both women jump at the sound.�
Moving to answer the door, he could see Amy go pale, no doubt thinking
that it was Kyle at the door. �Just say there and I will see who it is. If it
is Kyle, I�ll send him away and tell him to come back after the show.�� He still didn�t know what he would do to help
Amy, but he did know he needed more time to figure things out.� 

&nbsp;

Being prepared to see Kyle�s face, he was
surprised to see a girl who he had worked with quite a few times over the
years. �April, what a surprise! What brings you here?�� �Well, I was just in the neighbourhood and
noticed that you were going to be here. I thought I would see if you needed any
models.�� An idea was starting to form in
his mind as he considered April�s offer. �Well, now that you mention it, I
think you could be of some assistance. Come on in.� 

&nbsp;

Simone looked up to see whom Paul was
inviting in, smiling when she saw April.�
�April, what a lovely surprise. I didn�t know you were in town.�� She rose to hug April, leaving a still
worried looking Amy on the couch.� �I was
just telling Paul that I thought he might want a different model for one of his
sessions.� It has been too long since we
have worked together.�� Simone could see
Paul on the phone and was certain that he had a plan up his sleeve. When he
came back smiling, she knew she had been right. 

&nbsp;

�Ok, I just spoke to Tony to see if Kyle
was still there with him and asked him if he could keep him busy for another
few hours.� I suggested that he might let
him take part in some of the action and he agreed.� He going to ring back shortly to let me know
how he went.� If he can manage to keep
him busy, I will use April at my next show and Simone you can stay with
Amy.� If you sit in the booth behind the
stage, you will be safe even if Kyle comes back during the show.� After that, we will sit down and see what we
can do to try to get Amy out of her current situation.��� 

&nbsp;

Only a few minutes later the phone rang,
and by the look on his face, Simone could tell that Kyle would not be a problem
for at least a while longer. �Good, that is sorted.� Amy, will you stay with Simone while I go on
stage? The booth I mentioned is one where you can sit and see what is happening
but it is a mirror on the other side, so no one can see you. Hardly anyone
knows it is there, so the chances of Kyle finding it are very slim, though I
doubt he will around for a while anyway.��


&nbsp;

Amy�s head was spinning with everything
that had happened but she managed to answer him. �I can�t believe that you
would go to so much trouble for me. Of course I will stay with Simone.� This is the first time in months that I have
felt safe.� She could see April looking on with confusion but didn�t feel like
explaining anything to her at the moment.�
They all moved through a door that she had not even noticed before, it
being made to blend into the wall.� �This
booth in not only used to allow special people to view a show but also for
protection if needed.�� She was led into
the booth, almost bolting out again, as she saw the people standing around the
stage. �Don�t worry, they can�t see you, remember we can see them but no one
can see us.�

&nbsp;

Amy still felt strange about being so
seemingly visible to the waiting crowd around the stage, but managed to calm
herself as she sat down beside Simone.��
Paul made sure that they were both settled and returned to the dressing
room to prepare for the next show.� Amy
had a confused look on her face, watching Paul close the door behind him.� �What�s up love? You seem confused.�� 

&nbsp;

�I was just trying to figure him out.� Don�t get me wrong, he seems like a really
great guy, but I don�t know how he can do what he did to you on stage.� I suppose I just don�t get all this bondage
thing.�� She wasn�t sure how Simone would
react, but was definitely surprised when she began to laugh. �Sorry Amy, I�m
not laughing at you but I love how you call all this �that bondage thing�. I
guess for many people what we do is just wrong, but once you get to know the
scene more, you realise that most people are really very caring and
responsible.� Not that there are not
dangerous people out there, like Kyle.�

&nbsp;

Amy was not ready to talk about him yet, so
decided to find out more about Paul. �What do you know about Paul?� How did you meet him?�� Amy hoped she wasn�t being too nosy, but
Simone didn�t seem to worry. �We first met, oh, about five years ago.� I was going through a particularly hard
patch, mixing with a more extreme crowd and was at a party one night.� I had agreed to let this man use me in any
way he wanted, not really caring at the time what happened to me. I had had a
few loses in my life and I was just drifting.�
Anyway, by the time Paul entered the room I was in, I was in extreme
pain, my whole body suspended from the floor by ropes tied around my breasts. I
had then been whipped to the point where I was almost unconscious. Though I was
not aware of it, Paul had entered the room, having heard my screams from the
other room.� He told me later that he
could see that I was risking serious injury to my breasts if I stayed up much
longer and went to talk to my temporary Dom about it. What ensued was
apparently a quite heated discussion about safety, before the Dom decided he
had had enough and went off to find someone else to torture.

&nbsp;

The first time I remember seeing Paul was
when he had lowered me down from the suspension and laid me down on a nearby
couch.� The pain in my breasts as he
undid the ropes was appalling and I am sure that I used more than a few words I
shouldn�t have.� Anyway, he stayed with
me until I came back to my senses, and when I was able to stand, he had simply
led me to his car and drove me to his house.�
In my condition, I simply did not care, so that is why I made no protest
as he effectively took over my life. After a week of his care, I was starting
to feel better, not just my body but also my soul.� I found that we really were a great pair and
after a year or so we were married. We have been together for almost three
years�

&nbsp;

�What, you are married!� Oh I�m sorry, I don�t mean to sound rude but
I just had no idea.�� Amy heard Simone
laugh at her statement, not seeming to be annoyed at all.� �That is ok, I am used to it. It is not
something we advertise when we are at something like this.� Our friends and family know and that is
enough.� Trying to imagine what their home life must be like, Amy just couldn�t
imagine choosing to live full time with someone who could dominate you. She
hated every moment she was with Kyle, especially the constant fear of what he
would make her do. �What�.I mean, what is it like?�� 

&nbsp;

Simone could see that Amy was very curious
about why she would want to be in the type of relationship she was in.� �Amy, I know that your experiences with
bondage have not been good ones, but I am telling you the honest truth when I
say that I am exactly where I want to be.�
I have managed to find a safe and responsible partner who I trust with
my life.� We are equals in many ways, as
you have already seen today, but there are times when he is my master and I am
his slave.�� At this comment, Amy blushed
and looked away. �Amy, look at me. There is no fear in our relationship because
I know that if I ask him to stop something he will and then we will talk about
what I was feeling.�� We have a very
caring, loving marriage with some added extras that not every couple would
like.� 

&nbsp;

Amy heard the words that Simone was telling
her, but just could not make them fit with the images she had in her head. The
sight of Paul walking onto the stage ceased their conversation, both women
watching as he began talking to the crowd.�
Amy had heard what he was saying earlier, but found herself listening
with renewed interest due to what Simone had told her. She heard him speak
about the importance of communicating with your partner to find out limits, the
need for some kind of safe word or signal and about some more general aspects
of bondage. When April was invited out onto the stage, Amy could see that she
looked very excited and happy to be there.�
As the show progressed, Amy started to think about what Simone had said.
Maybe there really were people who liked that kind of thing, though she was
sure she was not one of them.� 

&nbsp;

�Amy, what do you think?� Can you see what I mean about trust?� 

&nbsp;

�I think so.� I can see that April is very happy though I
still can�t understand why anyone would want to be hurt like that.� It makes be feel sick to even think of the
pain that Kyle has made me suffer.�� 

&nbsp;

Simone took Amy�s hand in hers, squeezing
it as she spoke.� �I forgot for a moment
what a different type of situation you are in.�
I certainly would be fearful of someone I don�t trust.� We will work something out, believe me.�� �I am trying to.� I just don�t want to get my hopes up only to
find that nothing has changed.� To come so close to escaping Kyle�s clutches
and fail was not something she wanted to think about, so for now she had
decided to just enjoy her time away from him. 

&nbsp;

�Amy you said earlier that you did
something stupid and that is how Kyle began blackmailing you.� Could you explain what happened?� It may be helpful in trying to find a way to
help you.�

Chapter Three � A Stupid mistake

&nbsp;

Amy thought back to that night where it all
began and hoped she could trust Simone enough with the truth.� She knew that she could end up in jail if the
truth of what she had done got out.�
Taking a deep breath, she began to tell Simone her story.

&nbsp;

�It all started one Saturday night at
work.� Kyle and I both worked in the same
club and on this night we were the last two there, and so had the job of
closing up.� I had been working behind
the bar, so was in charge of putting the money in the safe and Kyle was busy
stacking up the chairs and sweeping the floor.�
I had had a bad week and had rent due the following morning. I had hoped
to earn enough in tips, but the night had been slow and I was short $200.� I knew that I would be able to get the money
from my parents but as I had to pay the rent before I would see them, I thought
that I would be able to return the money when I opened up on Monday morning,
the club being closed on Sunday.� I
thought that Kyle was still busy sweeping as I took the money from the safe and
placed it in my purse before locking the safe.�
When I stood up to finish wiping down the bar, I was surprised to see
Kyle standing there.

&nbsp;

I didn�t know what, if anything, he had
seen and decided to play it cool. �I
thought he might have seen something when he came around to my side of the bar
and stood behind me, his hands on my shoulders.�
Even then I was hoping he was only trying to crack on to me again,
having tried a number of times to get me to go out with him.� I didn�t dislike him then but he was not the
type of man I usually went out with. However, as soon as he bent down and
whispered in my ear, I knew that things were not going as I had hoped.� He told me that he had seen me take the money
and with my history of shoplifting, he said that the police would be very
interesting in what I had done.� I had
been arrested the year before for shoplifting and had six months left on a good
behaviour bond.� He knew about this after
over hearing me telling one of the other waitresses one day.� He told me that I would go to jail.� I asked him if I could just put the money
back; that I had made a mistake. He made me sweat it out for a few minutes,
pretending to be trying to decide what to do.�
Finally he made me look right at him.�
I can still see the look of excitement in his eyes, as if he was happy
that I would go to jail.� 

&nbsp;

He told me he had a plan that would keep me
out of jail but it would mean that I had to do exactly what he said.� At that time, all I could focus on was that
he wasn�t going to call the police.� If I
had had any idea what he meant, I would have taken jail any day.� 

&nbsp;

Amy paused to take a drink, needing a
moment to prepare herself to tell the next part of her story.� She was glad that Simone was just letting her
talk, finding it easier to be able to tell her story without
interruptions.� She had barely noticed
what had gone on with April and Paul and was momentarily surprised to see April
tied onto a cross with nasty looking clamps hanging from her nipples.� Paul was using a cane on her and she could
see the intent look on his face as he struck her breasts.� She wanted to block her ears at the sound of
her moans but forced herself to turn back to Simone and continue her story.

&nbsp;

Simone had been aware of Amy�s discomfort
at what was happening behind the glass, but didn�t want to distract her from
her story by talking to her about it.�
When she saw that Amy was ready to continue, she put down her own drink
and sat forward, wanting to know what had happened next.

&nbsp;

�He told me that if I would submit to him,
he would not call the police. Now, I had no idea what he meant but assumed that
he wanted to have sex and that would be that.�
I agreed, only thinking of my not having to go to jail. He even allowed
me to return the money and replaced the tape in the video so that the boss
would not see what I had done. This was not unusual, as he often changed the
tapes.� We locked up and I was not
surprised when he took me to his home in his car. He didn�t say anything as he
drove, but ran his hand up and down my thigh until he pulled into his driveway
and into his garage. He told me not to move and came around to my side of the
car.� The first sign that something was
not quite right was when he took a hold of my hair and forced me out of the
car.� 

&nbsp;

I yelled at him to stop, that he was
hurting me, but all he did was slap me across the face and tell me to be
quiet.� I was so stunned that he had
actually hit me that I was in his bedroom before I knew it.� He gripped me around the throat and told me
that he was in charge now and that I must call him sir.� I was choking and just wanted him to let me
go.� I begged him to release me, which he
did when I finally called him sir.� I
knew that I was in big trouble, but didn�t know how to get away from him.� He proceeded to make me strip for him,
sitting watching me from the bed.� Once I
was naked, he called me over to him and forced me onto my knees in front of
him.� I was made to give him a blowjob,
his big cock stretching my throat as he held my ears and forced my head up and
down.� It was just horrible; I had never
had a man treat me like that before and couldn�t help crying.� Kyle just laughed and told me I had better
get used to it.� I didn�t know what he
meant, still thinking that he would just want one night, and then I could go
back home.

&nbsp;

He made me stand again and turned me
around, taking both of my wrists in his hand.�
I felt him attach what I later knew were cuffs to my wrists and clip
these together, locking my hands behind my back. He was beginning to really
scare me by then and I made a dash for the door, just wanting to get away from
him.� Of course, I didn�t get very far
and only succeeded in making him angry.�
Gripping me by the hair, he pulled me back into the room and hit me so
hard I hit the wall.� I just lay there,
feeling my cheek sting where he had hit it.�
The night just went from bad to worse as he proceeded to force himself
on me. I had known he would want sex but this was unlike any sex I had ever
had.� 

&nbsp;

By the next morning, I was sore but glad
that I would be able to go home.� I still
can�t believe how na�ve I had been.�
After he had used my body again, he calmly started to tell me what my
life would be like from then on.� He said
that he had the tape and he could go to the police at any time unless I
continued to do what he said.� That was
when I knew I was stuck.� Over the last
three months he has made me do the most awful and humiliating things.� Of course, he has used any excuse to punish
me. So that is how I ended up here, though I am sure Kyle did not think that
you guys would treat me so nicely.� He
never makes me do anything that he doesn�t think will embarrass me.� 

&nbsp;

Simone had remained silent throughout Amy�s
story but now she stood up and bent down in front of her.� �Amy, I am so sorry for what you have been
through.� It is a sad fact of life that
there will always be evil people out there. I just want you to know that we will
not let you down.� She reached out and gave Amy a hug, feeling her hug her back
in a fierce grip.� When she let go, she
moved back so she could look at her again.

&nbsp;

�Simone, over the last few months I felt
like I was all alone. Kyle has made me break contact with my family and
friends, so I had forgotten what it feels like to be with a friend. Thank you
so much for all you have done, even if I have to go back to him, I will never
forget your kindness.� 

&nbsp;

Both girls were startled by Paul�s voice,
neither having noticed that he had finished and left the stage.� �Good to see that you two are getting along
so well. Under different circumstances, I would suggest that you both come home
and play.� He saw Amy blush at his comment, while Simone just looked up at him
and smiled. �Come on back into the room and I will tell you what I have thought
of to help Amy.� He could see that Amy looked so much more relaxed then she had
before and wondered what had gone on between the two.� 

&nbsp;

Back in the dressing room, Simone left Amy
to make a sandwich while she told Paul about what Amy had told her.� She was eager to know what Paul had thought
of to help, but knew he would not say anything until Amy was back sitting down.
Once they were all settled, she saw Paul sit down, his serious look back on his
face.

&nbsp;

�Amy, I have been thinking about some of
the ways we could get that bastard Kyle out of your life. Now they are all
fairly vague, but just listen and see if you like the sound of any of
them.� First of, we can have him beaten
up and warned of, but that will not really solve anything but make me feel better.
Another idea is to get you somewhere safe while he not around, but then you
will always be looking over your shoulder.�
My other idea is to give him a taste of his own medicine. I spoke to
Tony when I came of stage and he told me had lots of great footage of Kyle that
he had taken today, which he would not want to show his mother.� I don�t know a lot about him, but would I be
right in guessing that he keeps this side of his character a secret?�

&nbsp;

�Well, I had no idea what he was like and I
don�t think anyone else did either.� Most
people seem to think he is a great guy. Do you think it would work?�� Paul could hear the anxiety in her voice.
�Love, I really can�t say for sure, but I think it is our best bet.� What do you think? If you don�t want to risk
it, just say so.� 

&nbsp;

Amy considered what he was saying, but knew
that she had to take that chance to get free. � I just know that I can�t go on
with things the way they are. I would rather be dead then have to live my life
with him. So if you think it will work, then I would love you to give it a
go.�� 

&nbsp;

�Ok, then let�s get this set up.� I�ll give Tony another call and arrange to
meet him and Kyle.� It would be much
better to do this away from here.��
Everyone jumped as there was a knock on the door.� 

&nbsp;

�Oh God, what if that is him, what will I
do?� Amy could feel her old fear coming back at the thought that it was Kyle
coming back to get her.� 

&nbsp;

�If it is him, I will try to get rid of
him, I promise, though you may have to talk to him,�� Paul told her. She watched as he opened the
door, her heart beating so loudly she was sure everyone could hear it.� Even the presence of Simone beside her could
not calm her.� When Kyle walked in behind
Paul she began to shake, certain he would somehow know that they had been plotting
against him.� 

&nbsp;

�Hey, I totally lost track of the time, has
she been on yet?�� Kyle looked right at
her as he spoke, his blue eyes boring into her.�
�No, I rang Tony before the show and he told me that you were busy, so I
used another model.� However, if you want
I can use her in the next show at 5.00pm. It would mean you would have to hang
around for another hour or so though.��
All the time Paul was speaking, Kyle was glaring at Amy. He could see
her squirming under his gaze and so wanted to teach the man some manners.
However, he knew that he had to be patient and bide his time. Kyle finally
turned back to him.� Well, I suppose I could take Amy with me now, continue
looking around, and have her back in time for the show.� 

&nbsp;

Paul saw Amy go pale at Kyle�s suggestion,
but didn�t want to be seen to be making too much of a fuss in case he got
suspicious.� �Yes you could do that, but
she is most welcome to stay here with us if she likes.�� At this, Amy looked up hopefully, only to
have her hopes dashed.� �I don�t know, I
haven�t seen her much today and I had some plans for what we would do here
together. I will have her back by 4.45, would that give you enough time?�� Paul knew that to protest any more would look
strange, so he casually shrugged and said that would be fine.

&nbsp;

Simone could feel Amy shaking beside her
and had to fight the urge to take her by the hand and run.� She knew that Paul had to let him take her,
or else he would think something was up.�
The last thing she wanted them to do was to get her into more
trouble.� She squeezed Amy�s hand and
stood up, bringing Amy to her feet with her.

Chapter Four � Lies and Restraints

&nbsp;

Kyle took Amy�s arm and left the room.�� He led her down the hall, pulling her into
an alcove.� Amy felt herself being turned
to face him, his face only inches from hers.

&nbsp;

�Did you tell them anything?� You know, if I find out you did, you will be
sorry!�

&nbsp;

Amy had to breath deeply to make her face
look calm.� She knew that the only way
Paul�s plan would work would be if Kyle had no idea anything had changed.� 

&nbsp;

�I didn�t say anything Sir, I promise. I
was too scared of what you might do plus I didn�t like them very much.� They just like the whole bondage thing too
much.� Amy knew that the more she made Kyle think that she had not liked Paul
and Simone, the more he would make sure he sent her back to them.� 

&nbsp;

Kyle looked at Amy, seeing if she was
telling him the truth. He was sure she was, as Paul had not seemed any
different than before and he had not seemed worried about her leaving for a
while. �Ok then, we have to catch up on some things I had wanted to do today.� We had better get going so we can get as much
done as we can before you are due back.�

&nbsp;

Amy was so relived he believed her, but
tried hard not to show it.� She was led
back into the hall, seeing a stall that she was sure Kyle would take her to
first.� It was a stall with all variety
of restraints and bondage gear hanging and laying on tables. She could also see
an area behind the stall where people could try out the goods on sale. She was
not surprised when a moment later she was standing before this very stall. 

&nbsp;

Kyle could sense Amy looking at all of the
gear set out before her.� He loved making
her feel embarrassed and he knew that what he had in mind would be very
embarrassing.� He saw what he wanted to
try first in the area behind the tables and caught the attention of one of the
attendants.

&nbsp;

�Excuse me, is it ok if I try some things
out on my girlfriend Amy?� We are both
rather new to all this and don�t really know what everything is for yet.�� He was not surprised when the man offered to
help them personally, seeing him looking at Amy all the time he was talking to
him. This gave Kyle yet another idea on how he could embarrass her, but he
would keep that idea until after he had played a little bit.� 

&nbsp;

Amy walked in front of the two men into the
big area behind the tables.� She felt a
hand on her shoulder and let herself be led into a curtained off room.� The attendant told them both to wait and he
would go and get some items for them to try. The space was not very big and she
knew that with two men in the room with her, it would all become very
personal.� She saw the attendant lift the
curtain and enter the room with a variety of items.

&nbsp;

�Well folks, first of all my name is Ron
and I thank you for tyring out some of our items her today.� I hope we can find some things that you will
like. First of, let me tell you about what I have here.� For the next few
minutes, Ron told about the items, their cost and other relevant things they
needed to make an informed choice.�
�Right, now that is the boring part over, let�s gets on with something a
bit more fun.� Now, it�s 

Amy, isn�t it?� Would you stand up and Kyle, tell me what you
would like to see used on her first? Amy, I need you to remove you clothing,
but you can leave on your underwear.� It
will give you both a better idea of how the items will feel and fit if you have
less clothes to get in the way.� Amy began to remove her top and skirt, seeing
the smug look on Kyle� face as she did.�
She tried not to think about Ron seeing her in her underwear, not
wanting to give Kyle the satisfaction of seeing her embarrassed yet again.

&nbsp;

Kyle sorted through the different items;
finally pulling up the one item she feared the most. It looked like a ball gag
but had more straps on it than a usual gag. She thought Ron had called it something
like a harness gag.� She saw him hold it
up in front of her face and tell her to open up.� Amy opened her mouth, letting Ron push a ball
into her mouth. It was not much bigger than ones Kyle had used before, but the
addition of the straps going under her chin and up between her eyes felt very
strange.� She blushed as she was turned
to face a mirror on the sidewall, seeing the straps covering much of her
face.� Amy was so caught up in her image,
that she had not notice that Kyle had selected another item. 

&nbsp;

Kyle listened as Ron told him the correct
way to apply the arm binder that he was applying to Amy�s arms.� He could hear her gasping as Ron tightened
the ties, her arms completely enclosed by the leather binder.� Ron explained that the beauty of the binder
was that you could tie the arms as tightly or as loosely as you wanted. Kyle
insisted he wanted to see the tightest tie, so Ron was now pulling the strings
even tighter.� Kyle moved around to see
Amy�s face, making Ron think he was checking on her, but really just wanting to
see her pained expression.

&nbsp;

�How are you doing honey?� I hope the binder isn�t too tight? You know
that if anything gets too much, you just have to let me know.�� 

&nbsp;

Amy knew that he was just speaking that way
for show but still nodded her head. She did not wish to anger him and knew that
if she just played along for another hour or so, hopefully he would be out of
her life for good.� Kyle saw her nod,
pleased that she knew what was expected of her.�
He could see Ron buckling some straps over each shoulder, as he told him
that this would give Amy some support as well as keep the binder in place.� 

&nbsp;

Amy could feel her shoulders burning, her
arms made to rest side by side.� She
could see Kyle pick up the thing Ron had called a posture collar.� She had never seen anything like it before
and was feeling a little nervous as Ron approached her. 

&nbsp;

�Amy, you know that if you don�t want to
try anything you just have to shake your head.�
I am only here to help you both select some items you might want to
buy.� He was looking at her and she knew
she should nod to let him continue.

&nbsp;

�Ron, she is fine.� She just gets a bit nervous sometimes, but
she told me that she wanted to try some new things, isn�t that right honey?�
This time Amy did nod, seeing Ron look more confident as he started to place
the posture collar around her neck.�
�Amy, you need to put you chin up for me, that�s right.�� Amy felt him place the collar around her neck
and realised when he stepped back and she tried to drop her chin back down, she
couldn�t.� She turned so she could see
herself in the mirror; amazed at the way her head was now held up.� Kyle was already thinking of the
possibilities that a collar like that would have.� 

&nbsp;

�Ron, do you also sell nipple clamps and
weights?� I have used clothes pegs but
would like to try something different.��
Amy started to feel very nervous as Kyle talked to Ron. She had not
gotten used to the feel of pegs on her nipples, and wasn�t sure she wanted to
know what a clamp would feel like, let alone ones with weights. She turned her
body and saw Ron leave, jumping with surprise as she felt Kyle�s fingers
pinching her nipples. She had not seen his hand approaching, due to the
collar.� She gasped as Kyle twisted her
nipples, his eyes boring into hers. He let her go as Ron entered the room
again.

&nbsp;

�Here you go, I selected one of each type
we sell, just so you can find the ones you like the most.� For the next ten
minutes or so, Amy suffered the pain of a variety of different clamps being
attached to her nipples. All the time Kyle was acting like the caring partner
he wasn�t, making all the right noises to pretend he cared that she was
alright. She had just about decided that she could handle the different clamps,
when they started to try out the weights.�
After a few minutes of feeling like her nipples were about to fall off,
she could help the tears that rose in her eyes and started to run down her
face.� It was Ron who noticed first,
saying that maybe the weights were just too much and removing them.� She could see the anger briefly cross Kyle�s
face before he remembered he had to appear to care.� 

&nbsp;

Ron and Kyle tried out a more of the items
such as some different spreader bars and some different gags, including one in
a full hood. Amy had found that one extremely hard to take, not liking the way
it blocked of her hearing as well as her sight.�
She had had to really struggle to stay calm, relief flooding her when
the hood was finally removed.� Now she
was standing free of all restraints, waiting to be allowed to put her clothes
back on. Ron had brought her a drink of water as Kyle selected the items he
wanted to buy.� Amy had noted the full
mask, the harness gag and the posture collar among the items and was thankful
that, all things going well, she would never have to wear them again.� 

&nbsp;

Kyle looked at his watch, checking that he
still had enough time for the rest of his plan. �Ron, you have been so helpful,
we would like to do something for you.�
While you were out getting my bill ready, Amy decided she wanted to
thank you personally.� Amy was not sure she wanted to know where this was
going, but knew that once again she would have to go along with whatever Kyle
had in mind.� 

&nbsp;

�Let me just make sure I understand what
you are saying. Is it right that you are offering your girl to me?�� Ron nodded. �Alright! Amy is there anything
in particular you would like to do?� 

&nbsp;

Amy just looked at him, stunned by what
Kyle was expecting her to do.� She had
become used to him using her body, but this was the first he had ever offered
her to a stranger for sex.� She could see
Kyle glaring at her behind Ron, warning him with his eyes to not let Ron know
what she was really feeling.� 

&nbsp;

�Well, it is you who have been so helpful,
so you get to choose.�� Amy hoped that he
wouldn�t demand anything too much of her. �Ron, we have to be somewhere in
thirty minutes, so she is all yours until then. Is there somewhere you can go
or do you just want to stay here?�� Ron
told them that there were private rooms just down the hall a bit where they
could go.� Once Kyle had made his
purchases, they all headed off down the hall.

Chapter Five � Another new experience.

&nbsp;

Amy felt numb, her mind not seeing all the
sights around her.� When they reached the
area where the private rooms where, she could see a couple exit from one of the
doors, their flushed faces letting everyone know what they had been up to.� She saw Kyle go up to the counter near the
rooms, handing over the money necessary to rent a room for the next thirty
minutes.� He could see Amy trying to
appear cool with everything but the way she was fidgeting told him she wasn�t.
He smiled to himself, knowing he had succeeded in making her embarrassed yet
again.

�

Amy saw Kyle go to one of the rooms and
open the door, holding it so they could both enter.�� She had expected him to leave, but he just
sat down on a couch in the corner.� The
room was almost like a motel room, with a big double bed and a couch. She could
not see a bathroom, but there was a sink in the corner with a mirror above
it.� Ron walked with her into the room,
seeming to be a little embarrassed.� Kyle
stood and moved towards her until he was right in front of her.� 

&nbsp;

�Ron, I hope you don�t mind but I thought
it might be fun if we both stayed. I know it has been a fantasy of� Amy�s to be with two men at the same time,
isn�t that right Amy?�� He saw her nod,
her eyes wide with fear as he looked at her.�
�Of course, if that is not something you want to do, then �� 

&nbsp;

�No, that is ok by me, I mean this is all a
nice extra in my day, so whatever you guys are into, that is fine by me.�� Amy had hoped that Ron might not stay, but
knew now that there would be no stopping what was going to happen. She felt
Kyle removing her clothes again, until she was back in her underwear.� Expecting him to continue, Amy was surprised
when he stopped.

&nbsp;

�Ron, I thought you might like to remove
Amy�s underwear. I mean, I have done it many times but it would be a nice treat
for you.� Ron didn�t waste any time,�
moving closer to Amy so he could undo her bra.� Amy just stood still while she felt him
remove her bra, trying not to flinch as he touched her breasts.� He worked his hand down her stomach until he
reached the band at the top of her underpants.�
She had on a g-string, Kyle having insisted that if she had to wear
underwear, it at least be a sexy pair.�
He gently lowered her pants, his eyes taking in her bare pussy.� 

&nbsp;

�Wow, I really like that?� I bet it feels great.�� �Go on then and see.� Amy knows that I really like that look, so
she has been shaving just for me.� Amy had to bite her tongue to not say that
it defiantly was not her choice.� She
felt Ron slide his fingers across her pussy lips and then slowly work his
fingers into her.� Just as she was about
to step back, she felt Kyle grip her breasts from behind. He had obviously
undressed while Ron had been undressing her, as she could feel his cock rubbing
against her ass cheeks.� Kyle pinched her
nipples, twisting them firmly until she had to gasp at the pain. Ron had
stepped back to take of his clothes, so Kyle spun her around.� Leaning down, he whispered in her ear.

&nbsp;

�Amy, you are going to do everything you
are told, you understand that, don�t you? If I even think you are not behaving,
I will take out some of my new toys, like that hood you loved so much. Just nod
if you are going to be a good girl?�� He
saw Amy nod and stepped back� just as Ron
moved back to where they were standing.

&nbsp;

�Okay, lets get this show on the road. Amy,
I think it might be nice if you started Ron of with a blowjob, don�t you?�� He saw Amy move to knell in front of Ron and
take his cock into her mouth. He was fascinated by the sight before him, never
having seen her with another man. He suddenly remembered they had a time limit
and moved to take Amy�s hips in his hands.

&nbsp;

Amy was just taking Ron�s cock down her
throat, thinking that since he was not quite as big as Kyle, it was easier than
she was used to. She felt Kyle�s hands on her hips and almost chocked on Ron�s
cock as she felt his cock enter her pussy in one sudden thrust.� She tried to regain her balance as the two men
started to move in unison, making her feel like there was one big cock in
her.� She was grateful that Ron was not
as forceful as Kyle usually was, but still found herself struggling to catch
her breath with both men working in and out of her body.� 

&nbsp;

�Don�t cum Ron, we have not finished with Amy�s
fantasy yet.� Amy tried to think what he meant, when she felt herself being led
to the bed.� Kyle made her stand by the
side of the bed, while he got Ron to sit on the edge, waiting while Ron put a
condom on.� Kyle never used condoms,
knowing that they were both disease free and that Amy was on the pill. Kyle
pushed Amy forward, forcing her to straddle Ron�s legs.� Amy could feel the head of Ron�s cock at her
pussy as Kyle pushed down on her shoulders, making Ron�s cock enter her body.
She was moist from Kyle so Ron�s cock slid in easily.� She was again feeling that she could do this,
when she felt Ron pushing her down so her body was lying against Ron�s, her
breasts pressing into his chest.� The
feeling of Kyle pushing his cock into her asshole made her scream, Kyle�s hand
coming around to cover her mouth. She could hardly breath, the pain terrible,
as he pushed in further and further into her.�
She could see the concerned look on Ron�s face.

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry Ron, it is what she wanted. I
just imagine that the reality must be different from the fantasy. I am sure
that once we start moving, she will get into it more, right honey?�� Amy heard him speaking to Ron, but hadn�t
really heard what he was saying.� It
obviously hadn�t worried Kyle, as he started to move his cock in her ass. She
felt so full she didn�t know how they were able to move at all. Ron had started
to move as well, the feeling of the two cocks almost too much for her to
bear.� After a while, they seemed to get
co-ordinated with one cock retreating while the other pushed in.� She could feel Kyle�s hand in her hair,
pulling her head back towards him so he could again whisper in her ear.

&nbsp;

�So, how do you like it?� I bet you have never felt anything like this
before.� If I had known how you would look
with another man, I would have done this weeks ago.�

&nbsp;

He let go of her hair, taking her shoulders
in each hand so he could work himself in her even faster. Amy could hear her
moans of pain as the two cocks continued to move in her. Ron had also increased
his pace, no longer seeming to be so concerned about her.� Amy couldn�t stop her tears, feeling just so
used.� She screamed again as she felt the
two cocks start to swell, telling her that they were about to cum. Before she
could prepare herself, she felt Ron first and then Kyle cum. She felt Kyle
spurt in her, his cum bursting into her like it had been shot from a
cannon.� She was grateful that Ron used a
condom, as she could not imagine how much worse the feeling of two lots of cum
in her would feel like.� She was still
trying to catch her breath, when she felt Kyle move away from her, allowing her
to be lifted off Ron�s body.� 

&nbsp;

Kyle could see his cum running down her
legs as he stood her up. He hadn�t had such an intense sexual experience since
his first time with Amy. He could see Ron still lying on the bed, knowing that
he was one satisfied man, but he was not quite done yet.

&nbsp;

�Amy, don�t you think Ron would appreciate
it if you cleaned him up before he had to go back to work?�� He saw Amy glare at him, surprised at this
unexpected sign of confidence, before she moved to take Ron�s now limp cock in
her mouth.� He watched as her bottom
moved, loving the view.� He only wished
he had a camera with him, but planned to fix that next time.� 

&nbsp;

Amy realised she had almost blown it by
glaring at him the way she had, but she just couldn�t hide her contempt. She
had moved quickly to take Ron�s cock and clean it, using her tongue and mouth
as she had been taught. By the time she was done, she made sure she looked
down, giving Kyle no doubt that she was embarrassed. She knew she had succeeded
when she glanced up to see him smirking.�


&nbsp;

�Well Ron, we hate to love you and leave
you, but we have to get going. Amy is going to be a bondage model and she will
need a shower before going on. If you are not working, come and check it out.�
He saw Ron sit up, waving at them to leave and not wait for him.� They did that, dressing quickly and shutting
the door as Ron lay back down on the bed.

Chapter Six � Freedom?

&nbsp;

Simone looked at her watch for what felt
like the millionth time since Amy had left. April had stayed for a while,
curious as to Amy�s story. Simone had spent the rest of the time worrying about
Amy. Paul had been busy, setting up with Tony the images they would show Kyle
and working out how they might react to his different responses.� Simone heard the knock on the door, jumping
at the sound. Paul moved to answer the door, giving her a look that meant for
her to calm down a bit.� She picked up
her glass of water, taking sips as saw Paul open the door. 

&nbsp;

Paul made himself smile at Kyle, welcoming
them back.� He ushered Amy inside,
noticing how pale she looked despite her smile.�
He held his hand on Kyle�s arm, wanting to keep him from entering the
room. Kyle saw Amy cross over to where Simone was sitting, wondering why she
was hugging her if she disliked the woman so much. He was just about to say
something, when he felt Paul�s hand on his arm.

&nbsp;

�Kyle, I have another surprise for you. Remember
Tony?� Well, he came to see me before and
he told me that he would like you to have a reminder of your time with him. He
has made up a collection of some of the footage taken of you earlier, and there
is time if you want to see it before I go on. �The girls need time to get ready and as I run
the show, they can�t start without me. I am also rather curious to see the
footage myself, as Tony was going on what a natural with the whip you are.�� 

&nbsp;

Paul could see that he had said the right
thing by the look in Kyle�s eyes. As he had hoped, he seemed to be more intent
on seeing himself on the screen then staying her with Amy.� �Wow, that would be great.� I always wondered what I would look like
welding a whip.� If you think there is
time, then let�s go.� �

&nbsp;

Amy could see the two men talking, but
could not hear what they were saying. She was relieved to see them both leave,
with Paul making a thumb�s up signal as he went out the door.� Simone explained what the boys were up to,
watching Amy�s face light up with hope. �Simone, do you think it will work?
What if it backfires and I have to go back with him. After the last hour, I
have just had it.� 

&nbsp;

�Darling, Paul and Tony will do their very
best, so I am sure it will be ok. Do you want to tell me what happened when you
left here?� Amy wasn�t sure at first, but soon found herself confiding in
Simone what had gone on.

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, Paul was leading Kyle down to
the room that Tony had set up the big screen in. What Kyle would not know at
first, was that Tony had already downloaded the images onto his computer and
was ready to send them on to some places that Kyle might not like.� Through the help of some friends, he had been
able to get the address and email of Kyle�s boss, his parents,� his sporting team and even his old hometown
priest.� Paul led Kyle into the room,
letting him sit as he watched himself on the big screen, images of him whipping
the back of a girl before he had sex with her making Kyle smile from ear to
ear.

&nbsp;

Paul smiled at him, knowing that soon he
would be able to wipe his smile of for good.�
When the show was done, he sat down near him, ready to knock him down to
size.

&nbsp;

�Kyle, I think we could agree that was
pretty impressive. It is something that most people like to keep private,
wouldn�t you say?�� He saw Kyle nod, his
smile fading a little.� �I know I don�t
tell everyone I meet what I do, though I obviously don�t mind people finding
out. However, I get the impression that you might not like everyone knowing
what you like to do, would I be right?� Again Kyle nodded, the smile almost
gone.�� 

&nbsp;

�Kyle, if you look back at where Tony is,
you will see he has his computer out.�
While you were off doing whatever you were doing before, Tony was busy
finding out about you and your family and friends. Right now, he has emails
ready to send to a number of different people, like your parents and your
boss.� Tony will press the button to send
your parents a copy of what you have just seen unless you agree to do what we
ask.

&nbsp;

By now, Kyle smile was gone completely, and
he looked like he was about to be sick.

&nbsp;

�What do you want, if it is money, I don�t
have any. Just tell me what you want and I�ll do it. Please don�t send that
email.�

&nbsp;

Paul took a moment to savour his fear,
before speaking.

&nbsp;

�Well, what you can do is let Amy go.� She made one mistake and doesn�t deserve what
you have done to her.� Kyle want pale as he mentioned Amy, knowing that he was
caught. �Come on, what did she tell you?�
She loves practical jokes you know. That�s all this is, just a
joke.�� Paul could see from the look in
his eyes he was lying, but decided to play along for a moment.

&nbsp;

�Oh, a joke!�� Wow, she really had me going. I guess I
won�t need to ask you to get rid of the tape then.� At the mention of the tape,
he saw Kyle�s eyes widen and knew he had him.�
�That�s what I thought, all Amy told me is true and you will take Tony
back to your house later to let him see you destroy the tape.� Now, do I get Tony to say hi to your parents,
or maybe you would prefer your boss. We even have one for Fr Ryan, right
Tony?�� He saw Kyle go white as he
started to beg.

&nbsp;

�No, no, alright, you can have her.� Please don�t send those emails. My life would
be over if you did that.�� �Just like
Amy�s life was over the day you starting to blackmail her?� Ok, here is what is going to happen.� You are going to go with Tony to give him
that tape, you will leave your job and also the city if you know what is good
for you.�

&nbsp;

Kyle could only nod, feeling like his bones
had turned to water. 

&nbsp;

�Tony, could you get this asshole out of my
sight before I do something I might regret?.� Paul watched as Tony led Kyle out
of the room, seeing Tony having to support him.�
He had often wondered at how people who liked to bully others were so
weak themselves. He guessed it had something to do with low self-esteem.� He suddenly remembered that the women would
be waiting to know what had happened.

&nbsp;

He saw two anxious faces greet him as he
walked back in the room, trying to see if Kyle was with him. Amy felt as if she
had been holding her breath all the time Paul had been gone.� 

&nbsp;

�Well, what happened? Come on, tell us.�
Simone couldn�t wait one more second to know.�
�We got him!� He crumbled as soon
as he thought we would let his secret become public. Amy, you never need to see
him again.�

&nbsp;

Amy didn�t know whether to laugh or to cry.

&nbsp;

�Are you sure? What about the tape?� He could�����


&nbsp;

�Shh Amy, it is
all covered. Tony is going with Kyle to make sure he gets the tape and also to
help him pack. We suggested he find a new place in a new city.� Believe me, if he knows what is good for him,
he will never return.�

&nbsp;

Amy just felt so relieved that she could
not stop her tears, Simone holding her as she cried.� Once she had recovered, she began to think
about what she would do, where she would live. Her old unit had been rented
out, and she had long since been fired from her job.� Kyle had told her that after she hadn�t
returned for two weeks, they would not let her work there even if she turned up
again. She looked up as Simone stroked her hair.

&nbsp;

�Amy, Paul and I were talking while you
were gone about what you would do if everything worked out as planned.� We would like to invite you to stay with us
until you find your feet again.� Amy looked at them both, wondering if they
would expect her to join in with their bondage games.� Her face must have shown her thoughts as Paul
laughed.

&nbsp;

�Amy, I can see you wondering if you will
be walking into a bondage playground, but to be honest, when we are home we are
usually a boringly normal couple. I guess with doing this most weekends
somewhere, we tend to want to live a quiet live at home. Not the we don�t have
our moments, hey baby.�

&nbsp;

Amy saw Simone smile up at Paul, seeing
again the love and trust evident between the two.� �If you are willing to take me in, then yes,
thank you.� I can never repay you guys
for what you have done for me, but I will try to think of something.�

&nbsp;

Amy saw Paul smile at her. �Well, Amy you
are most welcome to join us in other ways, but seriously, you will find a safe
home with us. However, right now, we are late.�
If you excuse us, we have an audience waiting.�

&nbsp;

Amy watched them leave, marvelling at what
difference a day can make and looking forward to the days to come.

&nbsp;

The end.
