Night visit

Georgetown, July 2006

&nbsp;

I woke by someone touching my shoulder. It was dark in the room. First I
thought that something has happen to my grandfather. Yesterday my mother and my
younger brother drove off to Seattle, because we
received news from his nursing home that he had been transferred to the
hospital. Of course I would go too, but my father told me that we had to talk
to my teacher in the morning, before we could go and see him.

&nbsp;

Then I sat up in the dark and saw my father gagged and restrained with
handcuffs on his back. There were four persons in uniforms in the room.

&nbsp;

I tried to scream but at once one of them shovelled a gag ball in my
mouth. Another of them held my arms while they put some kind of leather
restraints on me. They must have estimated me to be a larger flight risk
because when they were finished I was restrained beyond imagination.

&nbsp;

Beside them leather cuffs I had a wide leather belt on with straps going
over my shoulder and between my legs. Before the strap between my legs came on
they put a diaper on. This was ridiculous: Me in underwear with diaper and more
leather restraints than I have seen in the local adult store.

&nbsp;

They took me downstairs and into the garage where they had parked their
car. Clever! Of course they could risk me being seen dressed as this. My father
was standing just behind me. They would properly put us in a car and drive off
with us to some place and demand ransom for us. This was just a fitting end to month
which had been one disaster after another.

&nbsp;

This one of them pulled a leather hood over my head and laced it tight.
I was in darkness.

&nbsp;

Me

&nbsp;

My name is Ann and I am 17. I have been a straight A-student for years
until the party at the school last week. Some of the boys had a bottle of booze
and I ended up drunk with Tom on the backseat of his car. It was not pleasant.
I certainly did not get anything out of it. Sex is an odd thing: Sometime it is
over quick, other times it takes two minutes. That is how it is with these
boys. Well, the next morning I tried to shower most of the next morning, but I
still felt dirty.

&nbsp;

My grades slipped and I got a reputation as the easy girl. I began to
stay out all night some times and when my parents imposed a curfew, I slipped
out the window.

&nbsp;

Some week after my school contacted my parents because I turned up
intoxicated one morning. A deal was struck between my parents and my teacher.
Every two week we should have a meeting until my school work was back on track.

&nbsp;

However, I continued to stay out and then one day I ended up in an
apartment where I was introduced to weed. It kept my mind off the boy-thing.
But I got the flu and had to stay home for almost a week before I got a chance
to back. I was about to pay when the police entered the apartment and I got
arrested.

&nbsp;

My parents picked me up at the police station. They were angry. Fortunately
the drug test was negative. Due to my illness the drugs was out of the
system.� I was only charged with staying
out past curfew (A new invention by the city hall in an attempt to stop gang
crime). But the talk we had when we got home turned into a fight and I
accidentally hit my mother before I was sent up to my room. The next morning
they started to talk about boarding school, but then my grandfather got ill.
What a crazy fucking month and now this.

&nbsp;

In the jungle

&nbsp;

They put me in the car and we drove off. Someone sat next to me. It must
be my dad. Who are these people? I know that my father has some kind of government
job, but it shouldn�t be one which should get someone to abduct us. It must be
the money, but then they must have some nerves doing this in the middle of an ordinary
residential neighbourhood.

&nbsp;

The drive took forever. Then we stopped.

&nbsp;

They took me out of the car and we got up some stairs. It felt �like an
aeroplane!

&nbsp;

I tried to twist but of course I could not get free. They took me very
firm under my arms and push me down in a chair where they strapped me down into
it.

&nbsp;

I felt the plane lift from the ground and I now I was very scared. I
peed in my pants. Then they took the hood off. My father sat in a chair in the
back of the plane and looked worried. He was still gagged. They removed the
gag. I coughed.

&nbsp;

�Slut! I mean you. Don�t bother to
scream. You will only be gagged once more. Here is some water to drink.�

&nbsp;

He held a cup up. I was thirsty. I gulped it down. It had an odd taste.

&nbsp;

They started to small-talk. It sounded like Spanish. Suddenly I felt
tired and dizzy. They must have put something in the water. The world turned
into darkness once more.

&nbsp;

When I woke we were on the road in a jeep. We were certain out of the
country. It was warm. The surroundings looked like a jungle. It was gagged once
again. When I turned my head, I could see my dad in a jeep behind us.

&nbsp;

We slowed down and one of the men took a blindfold up. Just before he
put it on, I saw an odd sight on a felt next to the road. Some boys were
pulling a cart with hay. Nothing out of the ordinary, but their outfit � it was
bizarre! It looked as they were used a human animals tied up to pull cart all
the day. Yes, we were definitive out of the country!

&nbsp;

Torture camp � day one

&nbsp;

When he removed the blindfold, we were inside a kind of camp. There was
cement walls all around the area and several cabins. I looked around. A lot of
people were sitting in stone circles at one corner. There were dog cages with
people in them in other corner. Why did they take us? Would they finish us off?

&nbsp;

We were lead into one of the cabin and placed in chairs. An officer
entered the room and he ordered our gags removed. �No questions! I am going to
say what is needed to say. You will be held here until our demands are met. We
will ask you some questions and I would advise you to answer truthfully or it
will be very unpleasant. Take the girl to the shower. She has messed herself.�

&nbsp;

On large woman entered the office and took me over to one of the other
cabins, where she freed me from the restraints and let me undress. It was
pointless to resist. She allowed me to shower and then I got an orange jumpsuit
as I have seen it on TV. I started to cry. I have seen the footage of hostages
getting their throat cut. She came over and took my shoulder. �Relax baby. We
are not going to kill you. Just tell us about you so your folks back home believe
us when we delivery our ransom note. Use the restroom now. It will properly
take some time before you get a second chance.�

&nbsp;

We got outside the cabin once more. I did not get any shoes on so I
tripped as carefully as I could on the ground. She took me to the corner with
the stone circles. They were about 6 feet apart.

&nbsp;

�Sit down.� I sat in the stone circle. �Here are the rules. Don�t speak
unless spoken to. Raise your hand whenever you need water. You can stand, walk
or sit in the circle, but not lie down. I will bring you some food. If you talk
to the others, you will be met with consequences. Understand�

&nbsp;

I nodded. It was not the reaction she expected. �Understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.�

&nbsp;

�Speak loud and clearly when you address me. Polite
please. Look into my eye. Understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. Madam�

&nbsp;

She gave me a bottle of water.

&nbsp;

I waited. It was hot. I saw my father coming out of the cabin and being
escorted to another cabin just up against the wall. I looked around. They had
security cameras. They seemed well organized.

&nbsp;

I lost track of time. Then the woman returned with a cup and a little
bag. �This is oatmeal. Make a fire and cook it with some water. If you can not
cook it eat it raw. Questions?�

&nbsp;

�How do I cook it? I have no lighter.�

&nbsp;

�Aha. City girl. Look there. Make some fire.�

&nbsp;

�But that is just some sticks, a little stone and a shoe lace. How can I
make fire with that? It is preposterous�

&nbsp;

�That kind of attitude won�t do you good here. If you ask me nicely I
can explain to you how you do.� Otherwise
just enjoy the raw lunch.�

&nbsp;

�But.�

&nbsp;

�Shut up until you have something nice to say.� Then she left.

&nbsp;

I knew it just as I yelled the first foul word at her. It was a mistake.
She produced a whistle and blew it. Suddenly soldiers came from nowhere and
forced me into the ground. They held me down until a man in a white coat
signalled them and called them to a cabin. I was dragged by four people into
the cabin where they put me on a couch. I was resting on my stomach and the man
in the white coat went into action as he bent my arm. I screamed. It hurt. He
applied pressure at some point in my back and pulled my should backwards. I
yielded bloody hell. He worked on my legs, my arms and my body. I did not think
that is was possible for my limb could be twisted so much. Suddenly I realised
that my father was in the room. He was crying. Tears went down over his face. Those
bastards! They had forced him to watch me being tortured. I begged them to
stop. Suddenly my father said �Lorrie� with a low voice. Lorrie is my middle
name, but I don�t use it and none in my family � even my father - has ever used
it. Odd!

&nbsp;

The man in the white coat took around my head and spoke with a Hispanic
accent �Relax�. I did. I was so afraid. With a quick move he twisted my head,
so I heard a crack. Had he killed me? No, I was still alive. �Once
more�. He did it to the other side.

&nbsp;

�Are you a good girl now?�

&nbsp;

�Yes�. I was crying

&nbsp;

�It is time to reflect upon your behaviour. Take her to OP!�

&nbsp;

The guards picked me up and carried me over to one of the other cabins.
Inside other children were lying quietly on their stomach with only a small
blanket to support their head. I was also told to lie down on my stomach and
before I got to think about it, I had placed my head on a blanket.

&nbsp;

�Here are the rules. Don�t move one inch, if you will avoid being treated
once more. You can ask for permission to go to the toilet. Questions?�

&nbsp;

�For how long am I going to stay here?�

&nbsp;

�Until we come for you.� He left.

&nbsp;

A guard was sitting in a chair watching us. A subdued weeping came from
one of the boys. The guard stood up from the chair and then the weeping stopped
at once. He sat down again. Time seems to come to a stop.

&nbsp;

My body hurt from the being positioned in such a manner.

&nbsp;

I don�t know for how long I stayed there. The other children were collected
one by one. I caught a glimpse of the eyes of one of the boys. Never in my life
had I seen such a sad look. I felt a tear running down over my face. I wanted
to wipe it off, but I did not dare.

&nbsp;

Then the woman came for me. �Did you learn your lesson?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.�

&nbsp;

�Yes. Madam!�

&nbsp;

�Yes. Madam�

&nbsp;

�It is time for dinner. You did not get any lunch.�

&nbsp;

I was back in the stone circle and she came with a plateful of soup. It
was not very tasty. There was even a dead maggot in it. But I was so hungry.
She stood and watched me.

&nbsp;

�Don�t eat too fast. If you vomit, I will force you to eat that as well.
You are going to finish it all or we will force feed you. We don�t like suicide
candidates here.�

&nbsp;

After dinner I continued to sit there. My father was escorted from a
cabin to a stone circle nearby. I so wanted to talk with him. But I did not
dare.

&nbsp;

The woman returned with a pen and a writing pad. On the first page there
was a kind of questionnaire. After name and address (Why did they ask for that?
Of course they knew where I lived. They took me from there!), there was all
kind of insulting questions. Did I have sex, how many partners, did I do drugs
or alcohol etc.

&nbsp;

Of course I lied on the accounts I knew my father did not know.

&nbsp;

When it became sunset, the woman took me to a hall where other children
were held. I got a blanket. Some of the children had a pillow and when I asked
the woman, she told me that I had to earn a pillow by being truthful and polite
the next couple of days.

&nbsp;

It was difficult to sleep. The thoughts raced through my mind. Why were
we here? What if our family could not pay? Also, the concrete we slept on was
hard to my body. None of the other children felt like talking. At last I feel
asleep.

Torture camp � day two

&nbsp;

I woke by a guard shouting commands at everyone. We were rushed into two
groups outside the cabin � girls and boys apart. We were told to run down to
the showers. We would exactly two minutes before the water would be turned off.
Of course we ran down in panic. The water was cold. There was no soap. But I
managed to undress and get a little of the dirt off. There were no towels, so
my body was soaked when I put the jumpsuit on.

&nbsp;

Then I was escorted to one of the dog cages. When I protested, the guard
blew a whistle. Suddenly there were about 6 guards pinning me down to the
ground. A guard brought my dad. Of course they want him to suffer seeing me.
This was sick. They took me inside the dog cage and tied me at my hands and
feet. Then they closed the cage. The sun burned me as I lied on my stomach
unable to move. My father was placed in a cage a little bit away and was told
not to speak. That was not the worst. Small ants began to run around by my
feet. They began to bite.

&nbsp;

I moaned from discomfort, but I tried to gather myself. I would not
scream. They should not have the pleasure of tormenting my poor dad. Two hours
later they came for us and took us to the stone circles again. The female guard
from yesterday came by.

&nbsp;

�It is lunch time. Do you want my advice today or are you into eating it
raw?�

&nbsp;

I had learned my lesson. �Please Madam. Please show my how to make
fire.�

&nbsp;

She kneeled down and took the shoe lace and tied it to the stick and the
showed me how to bow-drill as she called it.

&nbsp;

�Now you try. Be patient.�

&nbsp;

I worked and worked. It was frustrating. Suddenly smoke rose from the
wood. I blew carefully and then there was fire. The porridge tasted awful, but
I ate it anyway. My father was taken to one of the cabins during my lunch. When
did he get something to eat? Poor man!

&nbsp;

When I was finished, the guard came with the writing pad once more. She
sat down. �We have looked your answers over. I think that is time to talk about
you lack of accountability. Come with me.�

&nbsp;

I followed her. I was a large question mark. How did they know anything?
I have not talked with someone from outside the states.

&nbsp;

Inside one of the cabins, 3 other girls sat on some chairs in a circle.
There was an empty chair which I was told to sit in.

&nbsp;

At the far end of the room some adults were seated. My father was escorted
over to them, so I guessed that all of them were the parents of the girls in
the circle. I senior guard dressed as a doctor took the last chair in the
circle and started to speak.

&nbsp;

�We are going to discuss your answers of our little questionnaire.
Ashley: You stated that you are a virgin.�

&nbsp;

�Yes.� I looked at her. Who does she think she is kidding? Even I could
see that she lied him straight up in his face.

&nbsp;

The officer replied: �But you were lying. Of course we stake out our victims
for some time before we come for them. I even got a photo. Look!� He held up a
photo of a car where a girl was busy putting her bra back on. It was Ashley.
She totally lost it. She began sob without control. A woman on among the adults
also began to cry. It must be her mother.

&nbsp;

�And you have sex with more than one partner. He produced another photo
with Ashley in a very improper situation.�

&nbsp;

Ashley just stopped sobbing out of pure shock. Her mother cried out of
control. The doctor guard stood up in front of Ashley and took her arm and
rolled her sleeve up. �You even don�t like it. It causes you pain. You are a
cutter. You are a whore. You do it for phone cards to your mobile phone!� The
last sentence he almost shouted. Poor Ashley: She tried to say something, but
her jaw shivered. I could not understand what she was saying. Her mother sank
down to the floor, crying and sobbing. The whole scene was bizarre. It was like
seeing a Maury Povich show.

&nbsp;

Then he turned towards me. �You are also having sex with every male you
come across. Who at the school did you not have sex with?� He gave me three
photos with me and different boys on them. I was surprise. For how long had
they spied on us? �You have stolen money from your parents.�

&nbsp;

�No I did not.�

&nbsp;

He took a photo which showed me grabbing into my mothers purse. It must
have been taken with a telescope lens. I turned to my father. �It is not true��
I could see that tears were running down his face. I was busted. No need to lie
more about that. They seem to know it all - But how?

&nbsp;

�Confess and you will heal.� I could see how bad Ashley was doing. She
was dissolved in tears. I had to give him something to get him off my back. So
I told my story. I sobbed when I told him about my first time. How dirty I
felt. I told him about the weed. About how lucky I was when I got arrested.
Soon I had painted the full picture. I expected to be smeared once more, but
instead he took my shoulder. �Fine work � my girl. You will be fine.�

&nbsp;

It was as my confession made it easier for the other two girls to tell
their story. Inga had a long story of anger fit. She had been beating her
siblings and her parents. She had been playing them against each other pulling
her family apart.

&nbsp;

Mary-Beth was depressed as result of being bullied at school. She had
begun to drink every day making it almost impossible to handle her schoolwork.

&nbsp;

Even Ashley pulled herself together, and managed to give us an explanation
about her cutting herself. It was something about releasing pain from her body
when the blood flew down her arm.

&nbsp;

While we got it better by sharing our stories, it was certainly not the
case with our parents.

&nbsp;

When I passed my father on my way out, I could see the disgust in his
eyes.

&nbsp;

We were escorted back our stone circles. The guard sat down by me. �Your
Americans are all alike. Your parents spent a lot of time away from you minding
their own business and using their time on self-fulfilment instead of spending
time with their family. Kids like you end up in trouble without them having a clew
off before you end up in prison or in a body-bag. For your own sake: Use the
time until we get the ransom money to write about what you will do better if
you get out of here alive.�

&nbsp;

I wrote about how I would avoid boys. All they want was a quick fuck. All
tough I did not know whether I ever will get on speaking terms with my parents
again, I promised myself to stop drinking and doing drugs. These last days had
been so stressful that I did not have time to think about drug. It was funny.
The whole week, where I was in bed due to the flu, all I had in mine was weed.
It was gone. I was back in the real world and even the harsh conditions
considered. I did not want to do drugs again.

&nbsp;

But I had doubts about ever having a relationship with dad again. His
look after the group confession displayed a disappointment I never have seen
before. It was as I was no longer his daughter. Would he kick me out of my
home, when we returned? When � If � It was hopeless. I started to cry.

&nbsp;

It took hours before they came for us and I ended up sleeping yet another
night on the concrete floor.

Torture camp � day three

&nbsp;

After yet another morning marked by panic and stress, I expected to end
up in the stone circles again but instead they took me to the gate. I was told
to relax because they had received news from the states. I was going someplace
and I must not see where it was, so they put a leather hood with an opening for
the nose only over my head.

&nbsp;

I was guided somewhere and the female guard told me that I had to undress.
She helped me. Then I felt some leather restraints being applied. I did not
dare to resist. It was some kind of harness. They even gave me some kind of
high heels shoes on. This was odd. Leather cuffs were also put on and suddenly
the harness was connected something.

&nbsp;

The hood came off and as I look around, my jaw dropped. We were standing
outside the walls of the camp. My father was next to me. He also had a harness
on. As I studied him, they pulled a head harness over my head and began to
tighten it. Before I could protest, a bit gag was shovelled into my mouth. I
turned my head and saw that we were connected to a small wagon. My father
looked at me. The disgusting look on his face was gone. It was almost as he was
trying comfort me, but I could not understand what he said.

&nbsp;

The female guard entered the cart and gave me a soft lash with a whip.
It did not hurt as much as it surprised me. We started to walk. I received a
lash more indicating that we should increase our speed. I found it a little
difficult to walk and when I looked down at my shoes, the explanation was
clear. My shoes were shaped as hoofs.

&nbsp;

We must have run and walked for a half hour when we got to some kind of
a motel. The female guard came over to us. �Wait here. My replacement will
arrive in a minute.�

&nbsp;

We waited. People went in and out of the motel without even give us a
glimpse. Why I could not understand. Our look was bizarre. The harness on our
body covered our genitals but the rest was on wide leather straps. What kind of
country was this?

&nbsp;

�Hey pumpkin� I got a shock. It was mom! She went over to dad and kissed
him on his cheek. Of course he could not return it, but gave her thumbs up. She
took a seat in the car and guided us by the use of the reins only. No use of
the whip here.

&nbsp;

She had a map and after some miles, we came to a place where other carts
were loading rocks. Youths, also dressed in a bizarre way loaded the wagon.
Their clothes seemed to be a very long corset laced tight beyond every
imagination. How could they breathe? There was come kind of cover of their
genitals and the most of them seems to be cuffed at hands and feet with chains being
connected to the corset. The chains were so long that they could work, but they
were certainly not able to put up a serious fight.

&nbsp;

It became our turn and they began to load the cart without speaking to
us. When our cart was full we tried to pull it. It was impossible. One of the
girls came over and introduced herself as Amber. �I am a Level four student.
What seems to be the problem?�

&nbsp;

My mother told her that it seems that we were not able to pull the cart.
�No, problem I will motivate them.� She took the whip and gave us some lashes
across our butts. �No - Stop!� My mother tried to intervene, but guard held her
back. �Remember the contract you signed. They have to bond as a family � learn
to work together. If you want to assist them � Push the cart.� She ran to the
back of the cart. I managed to receive another lash before she began to push.
We pull as hard as we could and finally the cart moved. Once moving it was not
so heavy. Amber followed along making sure that we did not come to a stop. Both
mom and dad and not at least I were panting.

&nbsp;

When we about to arrive back to the camp, I noticed that it was not only
a camp. It was a campus like area, but at no time had I been able to see, what
was outside the walls.

&nbsp;

When we arrived back at the main gate, I read the big sign: �Meditation
Inlet � Alternative school for troubled teens.� 

&nbsp;

Other students freed us upon arrival and Amber took me with her. �Come
on now. Explanation will follow. You need a bath first.� 

&nbsp;

Family meeting

&nbsp;

I was escorted into the main building where I received a shower in the
basement. Then she took me into an odd kind of dressing room. �I am not going
to give you a long history now. Just do as I tell you or you will be forced to
do it.� She commanded me to stand under some kind of wooden bar. �Raise your
hands�. A very large woman entered the room. She looked very stern. I did not
like the feeling. I had just a towel wrapped around my body. When my arms were
in the air they both moved forward and grabbed them. Quick they had put them in
leather cuffs. The woman moved back and pressed a switch. The bar was hoisted.
I could barely touch the floor. Then they put cuffs on my wrist too. The bar
was hoisted once more. It was very unpleasant.

&nbsp;

Amber produced a corset which she wrapped around me. At once the large
woman started to pull the laces. It was as someone had kicked me in the
stomach. I begged them to stop but they didn�t seem to notice. Eventually they
stopped and I was lowered.

&nbsp;

�You need a dress. Come with me.� I had difficulties following her. I
was in fact panting and we were only walking. We arrived at a dressing room
where she found a kind of uniform. �Here you are.�

&nbsp;

�What is this?�

&nbsp;

�It is an exact replicate of a maid uniform from a wife school in Germany some 50 years
ago. We use a dress code here. Here are your pants.�

&nbsp;

It was a boring grey uniform, which look as something from an old prison.
Then a white apron was applied and the final touch was a mobcap. I looked as it
was a scene from �'Upstairs, Downstairs'�.

&nbsp;

Then she took me to a dinner room. When I entered, mom and dad were
already sitting in the room with a man. Father had also taken a shower and was
in a jump suit.

&nbsp;

We hugged and cried. Then the man took the word.

&nbsp;

�Ann: Welcome to Meditation Inlet. This is a school for troubled teens
and you have been through our family scare program. The program is a tough,
hard-hitting, high-impact adolescent residential treatment program. The goal is
to reveal which problems you are dealing with. My name is Helmut Gr�nehose and I am a therapist at this facility.�

&nbsp;

�Treatment centre? What treatment? I don�t need treatment. What kind of
joke is this? I thought we were abducted by terrorists or something like that.�

&nbsp;

He ignored my outcry. �The last couple of days have shown that there are
issues, which needs to be dealt with. As for the abduction, it is quite normal
for parents to hire a youth transport company to bring adolescents to treatment
rather than talking about these things in advance. Youth like you are always in
denial and it is time-consuming to make an intervention at home.�

&nbsp;

�I know that I large number of my fellow classmates has disappeared. I
even run into a former Straight A student, which sleeps in a park, because the
treatment, he got for being shy and introverted, got him to choose to leave
treatment when he turned 18. He got 50 dollars from the remote treatment centre
and his family has cut him off. He plays flute for money in the park as a living
and he was off for university before treatment. Is that what you have in mind
for me?�

&nbsp;

�No. Opposite most parents, your parents have decided that they want to
be involved very heavily in our rehab. That why our ed-con in the states
recommended this program instead of a normal stay. In fact, you are very lucky.
Every ed-con in the States is on the pay-roll from various programs, they refer
clients to. Your parents did choose one of our people. We are one of the few treatment
centres where the parents can be present from day one. Often seeing the parents
is something youth like you have to work for. It could take months.�

&nbsp;

�That�s why dad was taken too.�

&nbsp;

�Correct. Your father came along in order to observe you and stop our
people if we did go too far. One of the problems with programs is deaths due to
the staff thinking that the child is manipulating instead of having a real
problem. That�s why we gave him a stop-word.�

&nbsp;

�Stop-word?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. A word he should use if he thought that you were pushed past your
limit. In fact, he used it once.�

&nbsp;

�When?�

&nbsp;

�When you was being treated by our chiropractor. I believe that it
was your middle name.�

&nbsp;

�Aha. But what is the point of all this torment.�

&nbsp;

�The orientation phase as we call the first step in our programs, has is
designed to disorient and upset your everyday patterns of defiance and control.
We have designed it to take youth like you, which can be the rebellious,
selfish, undisciplined and defiant through a couple of events which can strip
you of your old defences, attitudes, and facades.�

&nbsp;

�What you are saying is that you squeezed me like an orange and I slopped
all my secrets out like juice.�

&nbsp;

�You can put it like that, but now we know what we are dealing with. We
have consulted about your progress in the program and our result is that all
the acting out on your behalf comes from you being pushed too far sexual by
your former boyfriend Tom. Your later actions were in fact a call for help, but
due to the shame you could not tell them straight in their face.�

&nbsp;

I could feel tears building up. I have tried to forget that evening. My
mother came over to me and held my shoulders. �Pumpkin.
It is all right. You may cry. I have been blind. I am so sorry.�

&nbsp;

I cried and sobbed for some minutes before I got hold of myself. Then
Mr. Gr�nehose continued: �We are going to offer you
one week in our Victorian purity program, where we would work on you being able
to trust a sexual partner again. If we do not address this issue, you will have
difficulties having a relationship for the rest of your life. Are you up for
it?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. I did not think that Tom�s assault would result in such a powerful
reaction. I would like to stay as long as I don�t have to pull carts.�

&nbsp;

�You won�t. The Victorian purity program is only about manners, cooking,
doing homework and treatment and some rest. It only thing out of the ordinary
is the uniform. We don�t like to restrain people and run-away is also something
we try to avoid. Being robbed of the most part of the lung capacity makes it difficult
to fight and run.�

&nbsp;

�But I am prepared to volunteer. Do I need to wear a corset?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. Something in society like laws can not be debated. At this place
it is our rules. You have to learn to live by those. We are not your parents,
so you can not manipulate us. However, it is only for a week and because it is
a short term program, you can choose out all time and leave the program. Your
parents will stay at the motel all time where you will join them at the end of
the week. But beware, the program is challenging and you will be pushed to the
limits emotionally. Do you still want to be here?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t think that I have a choice. I promised myself back at the stone
circle that I won�t go back to my old way of living. Something is needed to
heal me. This program could be the answer.�

&nbsp;

�Well. The next step is for you all to compose an impact letter. An
Impact letter is normally something the parents write and you won�t see before
you are banished to a treatment centre without the ability to reply, but we
think that acceptance of behaviour problems are easier achieved, when they are
discussed openly. Here are your notes from the stone circle. You can call me to
assist if you are stuck at an issue.�

&nbsp;

Four hours later we were finished. It was the first time for almost a
month where we were able to sit down and talk about deep issues. We laughed and
cried together as before my life became a mess. However, I knew that the rest
of my journey had to be on my own. I had to work hard in order to heal. My
impact letter ended up being like this.

&nbsp;

---------

Dear Ann.

&nbsp;

We have been worried that
your abandoned lifestyle would result in you throwing your life away. You have
been disobedient and retired from family life. We have sent you on this journey
so you can figure out how to pull yourself out of the malaise.

&nbsp;

We love you and will support
you all the way.

&nbsp;

Regards

&nbsp;

Mom and Dad

---------

&nbsp;

We had a dinner and then I followed them to the gate. Just as they got
onboard, Mr. Gr�nehose turned towards me and asked. �This
is your last chance. Do you want to participate in the program?�

&nbsp;

I nodded.

&nbsp;

A demanding program

&nbsp;

When my parents had left, Amber took me to my room. There were 4 beds.
Beside Amber, my roommates were Roslyn and Betty. 

&nbsp;

After dinner our last task for the day was to divide chores. In our
dorm, we had to select one person to the kitchen team, one person to cleaning
team and one person, which should help with �horses� at the stable. Amber was a
junior staff and her task was to guide us. I choose the cleaning team, because
I did not have any experience with stable life and kitchen duties was something
Betty liked.

&nbsp;

The next morning I was waked by Amber and told to downstairs and get a
uniform. My back hurt from sleeping in the corset. When I arrived the large
guard from yesterday was present. She told me to undress and handed me a black
uniform which look similar, but it was made of latex. I was afraid of asking
questions, but this would be warm and uncomfortable. Even the apron and mobcap
was made of latex.

&nbsp;

Back at the dorm I was told to clean the toilets. Due to the risk of
exposure of body fluids during the work which could increase the risk of
getting a sexually transmitted disease, I was told to wear goggles, face mask
and latex gloves.

&nbsp;

It was a very hot day. It had to be at least 40 degrees. I had to stop
working in order to have a glass of water several times. When the chores
finally were done, I was told to go to the study where they had reserved a
cubicle to me. Amber told me that my parents have talked with my old school and
they had sent my stuff here, so I with one � one supervised education could
catch up with my classmates back home. I worked until dinner and even after
dinner I had to study � still dressed in the latex uniform. It was unbearable
but none asked me if I wanted to change. About 9
 p.m. I finally was allowed to drink a cup of tea before I went to bed.

&nbsp;

I was stuck with the latex uniform for the entire week, because they had
forgotten to tell me that the disposition of chores was decided for a whole
week. There was only one bright side of having to wearing it. I got to take a
bath every second day. I was sweating like a pig. When I complained to a guard
about it, they told me that they in fact were happy that I was sweating so much.
My system would be cleared of alcohol and drug faster. When I had been into
bath they also gave me a fresh corset. The only problem was that they every
time laced it tighter. When I had been there for 5 days, Amber proudly told me
that I now had a waistline of 19 inches. I had lost at
least 10 pounds since I entered
the gate for the first time.

&nbsp;

Confronting
my evil demons.

&nbsp;

I was a little impatient. Every day I did chores and studied for more
than 10 hours. I had caught up with my classmates back home. But I had not
received any therapy. Then they told me to see Dr, Geil
who were one of their therapists.

&nbsp;

She greeted me and we talked about Tom and how I felt being with boys
after the incident. We must have talk about an hour when she told me to undress.
I did and she did also. �Ann. You have to gain trust to a partner. If you
continue to disconnect, you will never be able to enjoy sex. The problem is
that good sex is about trust and consent. If you are pushed further than you
consent to, it is abuse. We are going to do some exercises which will enable you
to trust a partner again. Please lie down there.�

&nbsp;

I was on my back in the bed, when she continued. �Now in order to trust
your feelings better, I am going to put a blindfold over your head and apply
some cuffs at your wrist and feet.� When I was restrained she started to touch
me very carefully asking me for my feeling about her doing it. She eventually
moved down over my body and ended up carefully stroking my clitoris. It felt
nice up to a certain point. I became aroused. Then just I was almost at the
climax, I tensed up and instead of pleasure it became painful.

&nbsp;

She stopped and removed the blindfolds. �Listen very carefully. This is
a serious problem. I need to block some more of your senses. I have to trust me
100 percent. Do you trust me?�

&nbsp;

She released me so I could make another exercise. She ordered me to sit
down in a chair and placed an empty chair in front of me. She told me to
imagine Tom sitting in it. The task was to tell Tom about the pain he had
caused me even yell if I would find it helpful.

&nbsp;

15 minutes later I was a sobbing wreck after having told the virtual
�Tom� about my feelings and that he did not control my life anymore. The doctor
held my shoulders and told me to rest for 10 minutes before she will tie my up
again. �You are doing well.�

&nbsp;

Back in bed restrained at hands and feet, she asked me again if I trust
her. I nodded. Then she pulled a hood down over my head. Inside the hood there
was a gag ball. She laced the hood tight so I could not hear. Then she closed
the openings, so I could not see. I was in total darkness. The only thing I
could hear was my breath making the hood moving. There was a small opening for
my nose. The gag ball was hollow, so I did not lack air.

&nbsp;

Suddenly I felt something tampering at my sphincter. Whatever it was
that entered me, it caused my pain. I tried to pull away, but it was inside
very fast. She must have lubricated it very well.

&nbsp;

Shock! It started to vibrate. At the same time, she touched me with some
vibrating device at my clitoris. It was too much. Again I twisted in my bonds.
Soon I realised that there was no escape and let my body relax. I began to
enjoy it. The item in my rectum seemed to grow in size. I began to sweat.
Suddenly I felt a trickling feeling running down my back. Waves of pleasure
began to roll through my body. It did not seem to stop. I was way better than
weed. I wanted to scream, but the gag ball stopped that efficient. All I could
manage was some moaning sounds.

&nbsp;

At the end I passed out.

&nbsp;

When I woke Dr. Geil informed me that she had
replaced the butt plug with a new none vibrating one. I should report to the
stable where they were experts in cleaning the behind of people. I found it a
little odd, but I was soon on my way.

&nbsp;

I was relieved. She had removed the burden of pain Tom had caused me due
to him having sex with me without consent.

&nbsp;

Preparing for home

&nbsp;

Once inside the stable I had to stop in order to see the bizarre environment.
There was some kind of carousel with 8 arms and chains running down from each
arm. There were also 8 youngster attached to each of the chains. They were all
gagged and in a leather corset laced very tight. Some of them were connected to
chains by a piercing in their nipples. No wonder they followed along. Others
were connected at D-rings placed somewhere on their bizarre outfit.

&nbsp;

I was brought out of my trance, when Amber spoke to me. I explained her,
what the doctor had said, and she guided me into a bath room, where I was told
to undress. I had to lie down on an odd kind of bench and when I did, she quick
applied a collar to me. One of the staff members gave me cuffs on my wrist and
feet. A wide leather strap over my body held me down. Amber told me what were
going to happen. �We have to give you an enema, because the lubricant the
doctor had put on the butt plug has to come out or else you will suffer mishaps
during your day. I am going to give you this gag ball, so you have something to
bite on, when you become stomach cramps.�

&nbsp;

She removed the butt plug but inserted another which had a tube connected
to it. Soon I felt water flowing inside me. First it was not that unpleasant
but then my stomach became filled. The flow stopped and Amber applied pressure
on my stomach so the result would be optimal. Then she left me. I tried to
shout after her, but it came out as some mumbled sounds.

&nbsp;

I began to suffer from stomach cramps. I hurt and I began to sob. Cold
sweat ran down over my body. It was very unpleasant.

&nbsp;

I was shivering when Amber returned. She released me and pulled the plug
when I was at the toilet. I had a shower before it was time for dinner and the
last leg of schoolwork.

&nbsp;

The day before my parents came for me, I sat down with Dr. Geil in order to talk my entire stay over.

&nbsp;

�First of all I have to say that I am happy with my stay here when it
comes to dealing with my personal problems, however I have some problems with
the stone-circles, dog cages, arm twisting and what you called observement placement �OP�. It seems to be very harsh. Is
that really necessary?�

&nbsp;

�All you were put through exist in reality at other behaviour modification
facilities. The stone-circles are something they have in Escalante, Utah. The dog cages
existed in Tecate, Mexico and OP, which is
now called special treatment or intervention, is something they use right down
the coast here in Jamaica. There is an
article in Observer called �The Last Resort� featuring the place. Yes, it is
necessary according to these program owners. However, we only use such harsh
methods in our family scare program and only when a parent is present, so they
can use the stop-word, before the child is hurt. After all the parents should know
their child better than some casual staff.�

&nbsp;

�You have not explained the use of arm-twisting neither the food with
insects.� 

&nbsp;

�The arm-twister is opposite the arm-twisting staff at other programs a
licensed chiropractor. I have looked in your notes and you should consult such
a person, when you are back in the States. Soccer-accident?�

&nbsp;

�No - Baseball accident. I went for a base
and I collided with a player from the other team.�

&nbsp;

�Well at other programs some of the children had broken bones. It does
not happen here. It hurts, but it is good in the long run. About the food: We
have a lab. Maggot etc. are grown in a sterile environment. We try to make the
food as close as the students in other programs get it.�

&nbsp;

�Well, it did not kill me. And someone claims that what does not kill
you makes you a stronger person.�

&nbsp;

�Do you feel ready to return home?�

&nbsp;

�I have my doubts. If it turns out, that I can not make it on my own,
will I be able to return.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, of course. As long as someone is paying the bill, we function like
most other programs for troubled youth. We don�t ask questions if a problem
needs to be fixed. As long as your parents or the insurance company will pay up
for treatment, you are welcome back anytime.�

&nbsp;

�Then I think that I will go back and prepare for my leave tomorrow.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, unfortunately such a short stay does not give room for a graduation
ceremony. I personal find our ceremony very exciting. Bye�

&nbsp;

�Bye. I am so thankful about your help.�

&nbsp;

Epilogue

&nbsp;

The next day my parents came for me. I was sitting in the office of Mr. Gr�nehose. My mom gasped when she noticed my uniform. �My god! It is latex. It must be unbearable hot.�

&nbsp;

�I have adjusted. No problem.�

&nbsp;

We talked for a while before I went down and showered. As a kind of souvenir
they sold me my uniform for a special price. �It will help you staying on track
if you keep it in your closet.�

&nbsp;

When we were on the plane back to the States, I sat next to my dad.

&nbsp;

�Dad?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, pumpkin.�

&nbsp;

�Why did you go with me? You could have called the escort team for me
alone.�

&nbsp;

�When we decided that we needed to address your way of living, we consulted
the ed-con. We had to choose between an ordinary stay or
this family connecting program. You know Larsen�s?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. Those with the son, who died on summer-camp.�

&nbsp;

�Correct. As it turned out it was not on summer camp. It was treatment
and his death took place when he was back home from treatment.
He had been molested at the program like a lot of those children, which are at
such behaviour modification facilities. In fact, suicide is quite common some
time after treatment when the implanted behaviour does not protect them from remembering
their ordeal. Therefore I wanted to come along, so I could keep an eye on you.�

&nbsp;

�Oh. Daddy. I am so grateful. I don�t know what
I would have done, if I had to go through such a treatment on my own.�

&nbsp;

�Mr. Gr�nehose told me about a new division
they are about to open. Family wilderness therapy in Siberia. Does it not sound
extreme? You know that I am an adventure guy.�

&nbsp;

�Let me just think about it.�

&nbsp;
