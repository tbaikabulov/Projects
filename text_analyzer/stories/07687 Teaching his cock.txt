Synopsis: 






She took him firmly by the hand and led him to the rear of the house. As she opened the door that led to the garden he gasped as the chilly night air brushed against his naked body shrivelling his flaccid penis even further.
She led him promptly down the path to the side of the house, turned the heavy key in a door and ushered him inside. It was dark, cool but not cold, and smelt of warm wax, leather and another smell he couldn&#8217;t identify. She closed the door behind them and turned they key, leaving it in the lock. Using a switch to her right, she looked upwards as the soft bulb flickered to life, lighting a wooden staircase that led down into what he presumed was a cellar. She turned to him and spoke in a soft voice �as we hit the bottom step, you lose all your rights, this is your final chance to change your mind� she reminded him. �Once the journey has begun there are only two ways it will end, I will end it, or you will quit� 
�I understand� he responded, his voice confident. They had exchanged many emails, texts and letters over the months; He had expressed his need quite clearly. He had for many years suffered with premature ejaculation and needed a solution. He also had regular fantasies about being dominated by a woman, and had assumed the two were related. He hoped that his idea of a session with a Domme would provide an answer to his problem.
She looked at him and smiled, he nodded in response they then descended the staircase together. As they neared the bottom, she slowed down, ensuring that he stepped onto the bottom stair first. 
�Mark� she called as his foot touched the cellar floor; he spun round to face her. �Fetch me something from the wardrobe� she said, pointing in the direction of a large double door oak unit, and tossing a key towards him. He caught the key and walked towards the wardrobe.
�Quickly� she ushered, her words encouraging him to walk faster.
He pulled open the door and saw just 3 items, a silk scarf, a bottle of lube and a large vibrator. He selected the lube and returned to her. As he approached she indicated to a single circle painted on the concrete floor, and suggested that he stand within it. He stood within the circle, lube bottle hand and looked at her. She walked to the edge of the circle and reached out with one hand, taking his flaccid penis in the palm, she rubbed it gently with her thumb. �I&#8217;m not surprised you orgasm to quickly Mark� she smiled, �you need to have some training, a cock is like a tool, you need to learn how to handle it properly, how to use it efficiently and when to get the best out of it� 
She rubbed her thumb along the soft shaft, encouraging it to swell and thicken. Her fingers wrapped around his growing member, teasing it too life, confusion filled his face, he had expected all manner of things, he had read stories of being tied up, being caned, being made to crawl on all fours at the feet of a Domme, and of being required to kiss her feet, being expected to tolerate all sorts of painful things, and here she was masturbating him happily, She had told him to expect the unexpected, but this didn&#8217;t make sense.
She worked her hands and fingers around his cock so beautifully, pulling it gently as it grew, his arousal becoming more apparent as she eased her finger over his crown. She held out the palm of her other hand, one word was spoken, clearly and simply �lube� he took the bottle and squirted a large amount into her outstretched palm, she cupped her hand under his testis and moulded her palm to his sac, massaging gently yet thoroughly, the first hand still paying his shaft attention as her strokes became more insistent, but still delicate.
After a few moments, she released his shaft and held her hand out, �lube� she stated, he complied. She eased her hand slowly up and down his shaft, the silkiness of the gel and the tenderness of her touch sent shivers down his spine, this was possibly the most erotic wank he had ever received.
�You will not orgasm, if you do, we will start again from the beginning� she calmly told him. �It doesn&#8217;t matter how many times we go through it today, you will accept all 3 things from the cupboard before you climax� 
His manhood was at its most erect, her words filled him with dread, he had never really had control of his orgasms, yet it filled him with delight at the same time, no one had ever spoken to him in such a determined manner before. 
The thought of her making him repeat this massage almost caused him to cum there and then, yet still she continued to massage his jewels with silk coated fingers, the feeling was most exquisite. She noticed the change in his breathing, noticed his erection begin to pulse as his enthusiasm increased. She offered her palm to him one more time, this time without words, he didn&#8217;t need them, he knew what was required and quickly expelled the lubricant into her hand, and she wrapped it around his shaft and increased the speed and depth of her attention, sliding smoothly up and down, increasing his desire rapidly.
As quickly as she had started she stopped, leaving him standing proudly to attention. She took a step back and watched as his cock throbbed gently, twitching with a need that had not been felt for some time.
She saw pre cum on the crowns tip, and looked him in the eye. �Select your next item, and whilst you are doing so I suggest you gather your thoughts, If you cum, we will start again. Go now, and be quick�
He left the painted circle, and returned to the cupboard, he paused for a moment debating which item to choose, knowing his resolve and inner strength was fading, and that if he wasn&#8217;t careful his body would soon defy him, he selected the silk scarf, hoping that it wouldn&#8217;t be as sensual or intense as the vibrator and would give him chance to regain his composure.
Seeing the scarf, she smiled and pointed to a hard chair that was placed against a wall. He took the scarf and sat down. The cold hard wood was not pleasant to sit on; his testicles touched the seat of the chair cooling his ardour momentarily. 
She walked up to him and knelt between his legs, his cock jumped with eagerness, she licked her lips tormenting him further, increasing his desire. He recalled the last time he had felt a woman&#8217;s lips around his cock, and how delicious it had felt, he caught his breath and prepared himself. 
She wrapped the silk scarf loosely around his hardness, drawing the material across his flesh, it was so tender, so delicate, and his thick swelling bucked and jolted as his imagination put her lips firmly around his cock. He couldn&#8217;t help himself, couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about her mouth encompassing his manhood. She wrapped the scarf around his tool and pulled softly on each end of the scarf, drawing the material tighter around him, in his mind it was her mouth, his eyes closed as the material grew even tighter, he throbbed and twitched, his balls tightened and despite a last minute desperate attempt on his behalf to fight it, his cock spewed a string of cum like an erupting volcano.
She saw what was happening, and quickly moved out of the way. As he gasped in horror that he had once again failed to control himself, she smirked, rose to her feet and returned the items he had previously chosen to the wardrobe.
She returned to the chair and took him by the hand to the bottom step of the stairway. 
She looked at his penis still dripping from his climax and then looked at him with an air of disappointment.
�It&#8217;s a shame you can&#8217;t obey a simple rule Mark, now we will have to start again, Go back to the cupboard and select your first item, you WILL accept all 3 things from the cupboard before you climax� 

�You have 30 seconds to compose yourself and make your new selection� she said as he walked towards the wardrobe once more. She just hoped that this time he would make a more sensible selection.
















His second lesson:

He composed himself, took a long deep breath, and opened the wardrobe door.&nbsp; Having just climaxed; he was confident that he would be able to resist this time, with knowledge that the lube meant an erotic masturbation session, and that the scarf reminded him of oral sex, Mark decided he should select the vibrator. He just hoped it was a wise choice.

She saw his selection, and pointed to a section of the wall that had two rope handles about 4 feet apart and 6 feet from the floor. Beneath each rope handle, painted onto the surface of the floor was a circle, about a foot in diameter, but placed back, away from the wall by some few feet.&nbsp; Place your hands securely in the handles, and a foot in each circle, you may decide if you wish to face the wall or not. I suggest you choose wisely she instructed.

Mark chose to face the wall, the position of the rope handles meant his arms were slightly above his shoulders and spread out somewhat. His feet, when placed in the circles on the floor meant he could stand up right, but that pulled on his arms so the best, most comfortable position was to lean forward slightly. This position also allowed her free enough access to front and rear to allow her to touch him anywhere she chose. 

She walked over to him slowly, her heels clicking on the concrete floor. As she got closer, she flicked on the vibrator and turned it to high, she rolled it across his buttocks slowly, teasingly passing it down the crack of his bottom cheeks. He jiggled nervously, and pulled himself forward towards the wall, removing his bottom from the vibrators touch almost instinctively. She followed his movement, and traced the vibrator slowly between his cheeks again, and once more he pulled forward.

She didn&#8217;t say a word; she just took one step closer and repeated the last action, slowly, drawing the vibrator down between the cheeks of his bottom. As he pulled away one last time, he realised his mistake, the full front of his body was touching the wall�� he now had no where to go! The vibrator slid down the crack and pushed in slightly so the tip was just millimetres into the fleshy slit. He shivered, as he felt his sac tighten, unsure if it was nerves or a renewed excitement that caused that reaction. At that moment she took a step to the side and slid her hand round his hip and towards his flaccid manhood. She pushed forward until the tip of her finger touched the soft skin of his cock, and she stroked softly.&nbsp; 

She leant forward and whispered in his ear, �present your cock to me Mark�, he naturally took a small step backwards to allow her greater access to his manhood, unfortunately in doing so he stepped back onto the vibrator, she held it loosely between his fleshy cheeks for a few moments then pulled it away a little and stroked his cock firmly. Her hands skilfully massaging it, teasing it to life again; As his erection grew in her hand she again found herself struggling for room to manoeuvre, she positioned the vibrator carefully, ensuring that it would at no point go any further than just into the fleshy pad of his crack, �present your cock better� she instructed. 
Mark took a small step back again and felt the buzz of the vibrator pressing against him, she had positioned it to perfection, he felt the sensation in the area of his anus, but not close enough to touch him there, it was all sensation and very little movement. With his legs parted so that his feet were in the rings of paint the crack of his bottom was slightly parted anyway, her aim was good, she tugged softly at his penis again, her fingers working up and down his shaft as is hardened and expanded. His erection wasn&#8217;t as strong this time but then, having climaxed so recently she wasn&#8217;t surprised. 

She placed the vibrator between his legs so it rested on the soft velvet skin between his sac and his anus. The tip of the vibrator touching the soft underside of his sac, her fingers still wrapped around his shaft, sliding slowly up and down his ever growing length. �I will let this go, if it falls, you might regret it� she said in a calm voice, causing him to clench his cheeks together to try and hold it in place.&nbsp; The sensations on his sac were incredible, he felt himself harden considerably. He clenched tighter and began to squirm in resistance. Her fingers relentless on his shaft, He moaned softly.

�What will your next selection be Mark� she enquired

�The scarf please� he responded, almost gasping as he gripped onto the vibrator, hoping it wouldn&#8217;t fall, her fingers left his cock, and he heard her footsteps as she walked to the wardrobe, he listened intently as she returned. Expecting to feel the scarf around his now swollen manhood, he was shocked when she placed it over his eyes like a blindfold, securing it tightly.

�Turn around Mark� she said calmly, then added �carefully�, watching him as he wriggled his hands from the rope handles, he turned around slowly, taking his time to ensure he didn&#8217;t allow the vibrator to fall, the movement of his body sent shivers of vibration into different parts of his sac, thrilling him, and shocking him at the same time. She lifted his hands and helped him place them back in the handles, put her hands on his hips and guided him back against the wall and then shuffled him side to side until she was happy with his position; All the while reminding him not to let the Vibrator fall.

She took his cock, and stroked it slowly. Feeling the veins swelling beneath her touch, she knelt down before him, and exhaled her warm breath over the sensitive tip, ensuring that he knew she was on her knees before him. The thrill shot threw him like a rocket and she knew it.&nbsp; His cock ached from his previous exertion, but he was ready to explode again. He groaned softly and thrust forward a little, she allowed him his whim and exhaled her breath on his crown once more, before she pulled away. 
�Remember Mark, if you cum, we will start again from the beginning� she calmly told him. �It doesn&#8217;t matter how many times we go through it today, you will accept 3 things from the cupboard before you climax�&nbsp; 
Her words ripped through him, twisting his gut, exciting him in ways he hadn&#8217;t experienced before.&nbsp; He needed to climax, wanted to climax, but at the same time, didn&#8217;t want the feelings he had to end.&nbsp; He couldn&#8217;t remember the last time his cock had felt so sensitive. He wanted to bury it inside her, but knew he wouldn&#8217;t be allowed and even if he was, he wouldn&#8217;t be able to hold back, and he certainly didn&#8217;t want to have to start again.
He groaned his acceptance, and then gasped in shock as she slipped her fingers fully around his penis and slid down the shaft. He knew without doubt that to climax now, would not be a sensible idea, but the touch of her fingers on his swollen shaft, the vibrations between his legs that reached into his balls, and the warmth of her breath on his tip made him harder than he had ever been.&nbsp; He thought his last erection was good, this one was the strongest he had ever had.
He felt his semen begin to rise, she felt it too, his cock twitched in her hand and he pulled and squirmed away quickly. To his horror the vibrator fell to the floor, he felt it slip, heard it land. He stood silent, vainly hoping she wouldn&#8217;t notice, yet realising how ridiculous that seemed.&nbsp; Seconds passed, she continued massaging his erection, her movements stronger, her strokes longer, urging him closer towards a climax. She brought him to the brink, his cock pulsing, and twitching with desire as he fought his physical need.&nbsp; She exhaled onto the tip and rhythmically wanked him, taking him closer, she felt his knees begin to buckle, saw his sac tighten and shrink in readiness.
And then, she stopped. 
His cock pulsed and twitched in silent protest but no seed was ejected, she retrieved the vibrator from the floor, and pressed it firmly against the dimple between his legs, beneath his sac, knowing this would apply pressure to his prostate and induce a stronger climax. She wrapped her fingers around him once more and stroked him. Not having seen it coming, he was shocked and surprised, he had let his guard down and now he had to pay the price.
�I told you, not to let this fall� she scolded, pressing the tip firmly against him, easing her hand back into a fast rhythm up and down his lube covered shaft, bringing him back to a heightened state of arousal rather promptly. �You will endure 3 minutes of slow stroking without cessation, followed by 2 minutes of fast stroking, as punishment for letting the vibrator go� 
He fidgeted, he was reaching the point of no return, for some reason the words she spoke excited him more, her fingers working his shaft through every word she spoke. 
�The time will start now� she instructed, her words causing him greater excitement, but the more he fidgeted, she slower she stroked, and the slower she stroked, the more she spoke.
�It doesn&#8217;t matter how many times we go through it today, you will accept all 3 things from the cupboard before you climax� she said as her fingers slid slowly down his shaft
�you will accept everything I give you� she continued as they pulled back to the tip

�You will wait� as they began their descent of his manhood again
�You will exercise self control &#8211; or I will control them for you� as her fingers massaged the full length of his shaft
The slowness of her hand, the strength of her words, the sure and certain knowledge that she meant every one of them, churned his stomach in the most exciting way imaginable.
He was impatient, the 3 minutes was taking a lifetime, and the waiting was incredible, his cock ached, his balls ached,&nbsp; she had him right on the edge, but was stroking him just to slowly to tip the balance.
�3 minutes Mark, then 2 more� She continued, stroking him incredibly softly, her fingers like silk over his lubricated shaft, increasing his pleasure immensely.
She then increased her speed, and slowed it down, teasing him, �are you ready for the second part Mark?� she enquired, he nodded cautiously, trying desperately to contain his enthusiasm.
Her strokes became looser, faster, more consistent, rhythmical, building him up higher, closer to the edge.
She leant forward and whispered in his ear �2 minutes, that&#8217;s 120 seconds, if you cum, I will start again�
His cock twitched once, she instantly released her grip, With out any further stimulation his cock pulsed and throbbed its release in a most unsatisfying way. She had stopped at the point of no return, affording him no satisfaction but not preventing his climax.
She allowed him to finish then removed his blindfold and helped him remove his hands from the rope handles.
�Clean the items and return them to the wardrobe Mark, you have 20 minutes to decide if you wish to try those 3 items again, or select from another group of toys, But either way, you will accept all 3 things before you cum, or we start again�
