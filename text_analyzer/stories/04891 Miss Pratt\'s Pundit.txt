MISS PRATT�S PUNDIT

&nbsp;

July 2, 1982

&nbsp;

The two&nbsp;&nbsp;girls
walked carefully, attempting to avoid the rusty cans and general litter on the
grounds of the&nbsp;&nbsp;Craddock-Childress Greens Mobile Home Village.&nbsp;
The taller girl, a pretty&nbsp;redhead in a&nbsp;bikini carried a boom-box,
which was emanating Boy George's sordid screams.

&nbsp;

The smaller girl had short, ratty
hair, and wore thick glasses and lugged a copy of &quot;War and
Peace&quot;&nbsp;bouncing against her soggy&nbsp;one-piece swimsuit.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&quot;Goddamn if that YMCA
pool is worth hitching to.,� the bespectacled girl
muttered. &quot;We could swim in the river if I wasn't afraid we were going to
get some kind of biochemical cancer, but with your luck, Serena, you'd probably
just get bigger breasts!&quot;

&nbsp;

Serena laughed and patted her younger friend on the back. &quot;Yours
will come, don't worry...just wait. Besides, you're getting out of here soon,
right?&nbsp;You're going to start at that Saint Casimir's School in six
weeks&nbsp;on your scholarship, right&nbsp;Prattsie?&quot; 

&nbsp;

Serena lit a Marlboro as she was walking. &quot;They might have a pool,
you know?&quot; 

&nbsp;

Prattsie grinned at her optimistic friend. &quot;I just wish you were
going with me, instead of to hairdressing school.&quot; Prattsie said
mournfully.

&nbsp;

Serena smiled, and tried to look
nonchalant. They'd been more than &quot;friends&quot; that summer, and the real
reason they were both pissed about the condition of the river was because it
was lots safer messin' around in the bushes than in the Y shower. But hey. They weren't lezzies, it was just a phase.

&nbsp;

As they reached a particularly
filthy singlewide mobile home with a large&nbsp; hand-painted
sign saying &quot;B.Pratt Home&nbsp;Keepe Owt&quot; in the front yard, Serena's
radio did a fizzle. 

&nbsp;

Suddenly� Boy George
was gone and instead it was one of those boring talk shows

Before Serena could flip the
station, they heard

&nbsp;

. &quot;...And the Equal Rights
Amendment was defeated on June thirtieth when the required 38 state
legislatures did not ratify in time. Today I have Tegan O'Kesen, president of
Smith College Christians Against Rights Initiatives.
SCCARI girls worked with Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum and the Concerned Women
of America to defeat the ERA, and Miss O'Kesen is proud of her good work. Miss
O'Kesen?&quot;

&nbsp;

Serena looked bored and Prattsie
disgusted as a nasal female voice came on.

&nbsp;

�&quot;Yes, that's right, Myron. We� SCCARI women
worked to shut down the Equal Rights Amendment because women don't need it.
Every woman in America has all the rights she needs, and if she isn't enjoying
life, it's her attitude! All a woman has to learn is how to be a feminine and
obedient wife...&quot;

&nbsp;

Serena turned the station to
&quot;I Want a New Drug&quot; by Huey Lewis and the News, but Prattsie still
looked a bit put out.

&nbsp;

Suddenly there was a sound of
ripping and screaming from inside the &quot;B Pratt&quot; trailer. &quot;I'll
teach you to hide my Dilaudids, you bitch!&quot; came&nbsp;a
man's voice, and then there was a crash. Suddenly the trailer was rocking with
a woman's screams and&nbsp;a man's coarse laughter.

&nbsp;

�Stop, Thurman, you�re killin�
me!!!� Two small children came out of the mobile home, turning their dirty faces
to Prattsie, instinctively. 

&nbsp;

��Kelvin, Colette, go to the Recreation
 Center for a couple hours.� Prattsie said, sighing. �Here�s a five
for the Pac-Man machine, now get on out of here!� Don�t come back �til dark. And wash in the
sink at the Rec Center, or I�ll beat you both to a pulp!�

&nbsp;

�The two urchins chortled over their change of
fortune and ran off. �And thus go half my Dairy Queen tips� the bespectacled
girl moaned.

&nbsp;

Suddenly there was a slam inside
the trailer and a further scream, and a lower denture plate flew out of the
door, and Prattsie caught it with a practiced air.

&nbsp;

Serena looked uncomfortable.
Prattsie smiled ruefully. &quot;I gotta go inside and keep Momma from being
killed again. Let's go swimming again tomorrow.&quot;

&nbsp;

Serena gave her friend a quick hug
and ran down the filth littered path, as her&nbsp;own uncle&nbsp;was probably
making advances to her younger sister in THEIR trailer, and it couldn't hurt to
get home soon. 

&nbsp;

February 19, 2004
9:43 a.m.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well it is a problem,
Prattsie,&quot; said Samuel, embarrassed. &quot;I probably shouldn't have let
Kenseth come here without getting fixed first.&quot; Samuel leaned down on the
stool, looking into the &quot;coffin&quot; a retired telephone booth that was
lying on its side. Samuel shook his large black head. &quot;It's the younger generation.
Although my father had my brother and I before his
operation, I was proud to be snipped in mid puberty.&quot;

&nbsp;

Samuel leaned his bulky arms on
the &quot;Coffin&quot; because it was moving around, as its occupant kept
bouncing and bucking about. &quot;I am ashamed of Kenseth's attitude. He is my
brother's son, but his attitudes are terrible.

&nbsp;

�His sister is even worse. Can you
believe&nbsp;Sibongile refused to be a volcano virgin, Prattsie?&quot; Samuel
shook his giant head again, and Miss Pratt thought it resembled a watermelon.
&quot;She is a waitress in Madagascar, and has a therapist!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Secular bitch!&quot; Miss Pratt said with a grin. &quot;These kids, I tell you,
Samuel. Worldly little bastards.&quot;

&nbsp;

It was taped together so there
were no air holes except for those on the top door, and inside it was Evelyn,
covered in sugar water. Miss Pratt poured more sugar water on Evelyn, who
closed her eyes and shook herself. 

&nbsp;

Miss Pratt made a face. Evelyn,
naked, even with her ugly, wrinkled hands cuffed behind her back, was a hideous
sight. 

&nbsp;

&quot;What's the problem,
Samuel?&quot; Miss Pratt asked casually. &quot;He's been watching &quot;Sex in
the City&quot; and &quot;Entourage&quot; and he wants to get laid before he
becomes a eunuch?&quot;

&nbsp;

Samuel looked to the box of fire
ants, and Miss Pratt nodded. Samuel frowned as he opened the box. &quot;These
are from Puerto Rico, and they cost a pretty penny.&quot; Backing away a bit, he
opened the door to the Coffin. &quot;Are you ready for your surprise,
Evelyn?&quot;

&nbsp;

Evelyn looked up through eyes
blurry with sugar water. &quot;I don't understand this, I'm all sticky...what
sort of--Oh!&quot; She winced and pulled as the fire ants began falling onto
her face and began crawling over her body.� No, please Samuel...don't do this to me!&quot;

&nbsp;

Miss Pratt shook her head. &quot;I
can't stand to hear her whining. Did the bait shop send crickets, too? I think
I'll listen to some Toni Braxton while you pour those on.&quot;

&nbsp;

Samuel grinned broadly. &quot;You
are so easy to torture. Shakespeare said that we despise in others what we
perceive in ourselves, and for the decade that I have known you, Prattsie, you
have been a greater whiner than poor Evelyn.&quot;

&nbsp;

�Samuel looked down, as the crickets followed
the fire ants, onto the struggling, shaking fifty-six year old woman.
&quot;They're biting me...please, Noooo!&quot; Samuel shook his head again.

&nbsp;

&quot;Before I put on the
headphones, what do you want to do about Kenseth? Do you think if I got him
laid with a hooker perhaps he would be content to go home and get his
castration?&quot; Miss Pratt was concerned here. Samuel was not at all close to
retirement, but it was always good to have a spare eunuch around.

&nbsp;

&quot;Kenseth just wants to have
his schlong sucked.&quot; Samuel said with a smile. &quot;Perhaps you can order
in someone, attractive...&quot; Miss Pratt snapped her fingers. &quot;You know,
I have a Sarah-Jessica Parker coming in today who is just the one!&quot;

&nbsp;

Samuel winced. &quot;No, no,
Prattsie, I don't think Miss&nbsp;O�Kesen is interested in men.&quot; But Miss
Pratt had put the earphones on, and, while watching Evelyn's misery, was
snapping her fingers to &quot;Breathe Again.&quot;

�

February 19, 2004.
1:39 pm

Glynnis couldn't believe that she
was looking at Tegan O'Kesen. Of course they both lived in DC, so Glyn knew
that there was always a possibility of seeing a television celebrity--she'd
once been on the Metro with David Broder, and Walter Mondale used to shop at
Giant Food with Glyn's mom. He was very nice.

&nbsp;

God, the telephone books were
heavy. Glyn never would have guessed that she could hold one telephone book in
both hands for an hour standing up, much less a heavy book in each hand while
standing with her feet in two different chairs.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Glyn's right hand sagged a
bit under its book, but Miss Pratt looked quickly at her, while regaling O'Kesen, and Glynnis pulled up her hand.

&nbsp;

But Tegan O'Kesen was such a
bitch! Like most DC residents, Glynnis was a liberal, and everyone thought
O'Kesen was a right-wing bimbo.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;But God, how she wished she
could tell her friends that she'd seen the right-wing bimbo being caned by Miss
Pratt! But of course none of Glyn's friends knew that Glynnis, herself saw a domme.

&nbsp;

Glynnis's right knee was starting to really smart, and she was terrified that the chair under
her right foot might go out, and she'd fall. Glyn was forty-eight and didn't
think she could be falling down hard.

&nbsp;

Earlier, Miss Pratt had caned
Glynnis viciously because Glyn had been preparing Miss Pratt's lunch and had
stepped on the white squares of the black and white kitchen tile floor.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Miss Pratt had ordered
Kenseth, the obese black younger guy, to monitor Glyn, who owned four
restaurants and was a published cookbook author, in making the meal, but it was
hard to concentrate on a good bouillabaisse&nbsp; while
worrying about what tiles to step on.

&nbsp;

It had been grim. Miss Pratt had
waited until Glynnis had served the lunch, and even kindly waited til Glyn had
eaten her share out of the dog dish before punishing her.

&nbsp;

Glynnis had had no idea whether
Miss Pratt was upset or not, as Miss Pratt had complimented her on the meal
before bringing up the indelicate matter of stepping on white tiles, and then the
Tickler came into play, and Glyn had danced and cried for nearly twenty-five
minutes.

&nbsp;

Then, of course after the pain of
the thrashing was up, Glynnis had stupidly thought because she'd paid $500 for
the privilege of making Miss Pratt's lunch, that now she might be allowed to
worship at Miss Pratt's pussy.

&nbsp;

But no, instead Glyn had to stand
on chairs, holding the Yellow Pages and watching Miss Pratt tear apart America's sweetheart conservative...Oh, God.

&nbsp;

FEBRUARY 19TH, 1:51 pm.

&nbsp;

Tegan bit her lip. The Tickler had stung her left buttock
deeply. Miss Pratt knew how to scientifically apply the cane. She knew that
just under the butt, there was a sensitive spot that could make poor Tay
burst into tears just with a light touch.

&nbsp;

But they were in a �resting period� now. Miss Pratt was
sitting comfortably in her LaZ boy armchair, reading aloud, while Tay
was trying to avoid having splinters embedded in her tender stomach, from this
vile carpenter�s sawhorse.

&nbsp;

Tay looked over at the poor fat
woman who was standing on the chairs, holding the telephone books. That must be
in a way, worse than being hung over the goddamned sawhorse. How ghastly her
stomach would look with splinters in it.

&nbsp;

Oh, God. Tay�s nipples were in
sorry shape as well. Miss Pratt had purchased little steel things called �Baby
Jaws� and they had TEETH. Tiny thumb screwed pinchers attached rather harshly
to Tay�s sensitive nipples, made more sensitive after
they�d been whacked by the Tickler.

&nbsp;

Tears were coursing down Tegan�s face as she listened to
Miss Pratt�s cheerful voice as she finished the article in �American Virtue�
magazine.

&nbsp;

��Nationally syndicated columnist Tegan O�Kesan, host of
�Blondes for the Bible� and author of�
�Trapped in Gomorrah�, �Mascara is my Talisman� and �A Fetus Named Dot�
agrees with the President of Family Empowerment Coalition. �

&nbsp;

Miss Pratt paused, and took a barroom dart out of a bowl
on the little table next to her beloved LaZ-Boy. She threw it expertly, and it
landed in Tegan�s left thigh. Tay shrieked and jiggled,
and the dart fell on the floor, and Miss Pratt laughed, and continued reading
from �American Virtue�

&nbsp;

��But O�Kesan says gay marriage is more juvenile then
sinful. �The so-called gays are tired of their party, and now want to play
house as if they were the rest of us. It�s a pollution of our values and
commitment. Only in Massachusetts,
where sodomites like Barney Frank and Gerry Studds have represented the voters
could such a travesty of sociologically deficient��

&nbsp;

�Stop reading, please Miss Pratt.� Tegan turned to Miss
Pratt, and adjusted her self still uncomfortably on the harsh sawhorse. Tay
knew that interrupting Miss Pratt would probably earn her more �caresses� from
Tickles, Miss Pratt�s fiberglass cane, but she couldn�t bear to hear any more.

&nbsp;

Miss Pratt threw another dart at Tay�s
buttocks, but it embedded itself in her hip, and stayed there, as Tay
cried bitterly.

&nbsp;

�But why, honey?� Miss Pratt asked Tegan innocently. �I�m
so proud to have a client who is so full of interesting opinions about the sociological
deficiency of we carpet-munchers. And so interested in
the way my friends and I live. It�s great that there�s an opinion like yours
poking in our business.� Miss Pratt sighed theatrically.

&nbsp;

�I recall a few months ago, wasn�t it, that a pregnant Idaho
woman had a car accident, and she was in a coma�� Miss
Pratt paused.

&nbsp;

�That happened two years ago, ma�am. And I was younger.�
Oh dear. I�ve interrupted her again, Tegan thought

&nbsp;

Miss Pratt smiled. �Yes, two years ago. A woman is in a
coma, her husband is arranging to get her an abortion so she can come out of
the coma, and you and your pro-lifers SUE for custody
of the fetus�you�ve never met her, you don�t know her.

&nbsp;

But God forbid you don�t get involved. Thank God, that was
thrown out of court.�

Miss Pratt dropped �American Virtue� on the floor, and
picked up the Tickler. She arose from her LaZ-Boy.

&nbsp;

�How are you doing Glynnis?� Miss Pratt asked with a
smile. �I�m doing fine, Miss Pratt� Glynnis said with a weak smile back. The
heavy telephone books were really weighing Glynnis down, but she was trying,
Tay thought. The poor fat woman. Why would a woman put herself in that
position? 

&nbsp;

But then again, I�m here too, Tay thought. And my slit is
wet, and I�m probably going to masturbate like crazy when I get home, and that
woman will too. 

&nbsp;

�You seem depressed, Glynnis. Why don�t you cheer up?�
Miss Pratt asked. WHACK! The Tickler slammed against Glynnis�s protruding
stomach. Glynnis grabbed her stomach, and dropped both telephone books. One hit
Miss Pratt on the toe.

&nbsp;

It didn�t really hurt, but Miss Pratt made the most of it,
anyway. �Aaah!� she screamed, and began whacking Glyn with vigor. �You are a
fat, ugly pig.� WHACK WHACK WHACK! �The sight of you makes me ill! I can�t
believe something as disgusting as you is alive�and you throw books on my
feet!�

&nbsp;

Glynnis fell off the chair and Miss Pratt whacked the
Tickler on her prone body. �Get out of here, you emetic pig�.don�t come back
until your appointment next week!� The fat woman ran out of the room, and Miss
Pratt leaned back, sighing in satisfaction.

&nbsp;

�She really does cook well, Tegan.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Then Miss Pratt strolled towards Tegan�s sawhorse. The
Tickler swung through the air.

&nbsp;

Tay was now really worried. This was the first time Miss
Pratt ever dragged politics into their sessions. And here she was, Tegan
O�Kesan, Harvard Law Review editor, Miss Pottsville County, journalist, and TV
show host�and submissive slave to an angry lesbian!

&nbsp;

Here Tegan was, bent over the sawhorse, her right wrist
cuffed to her right ankle, resting on the floor, and left wrist handcuffed to
left ankle. And she�d paid $400 for this dubious privilege.

&nbsp;

Miss Pratt looked at the duct tape that Samuel had
thoughtfully placed between Tegan�s legs earlier. �So I told you to shave your
pubes, and you didn�t�but this will take care of it, methinks.� Savagely, Miss
Pratt ripped the duct tape out from between Tay�s legs and she screamed.

&nbsp;

�Such an intellect, our Tay O�Kesen.� Miss Pratt tossed
the crumpled duct tape in a corner. Samuel would curse her later when he was
doing the housework. �Anti-homosexual activism��

&nbsp;

Tay closed her eyes, knowing that the worst was yet to
come.

&nbsp;

�It�s tough being queer.� Miss Pratt said, meditatively.
Reaching over, she yanked the dart out of Tay�s thigh, and Tay screamed. �Want
something to cry about, dearie?� Miss Pratt bent the Tickler and swung it in
the air sharply. Tay�s straight blond hair bounced as she winced and held her
head low against her heavy breasts.

&nbsp;

Oh, please don�t let her hit me again, Tay thought.

&nbsp;

�The Tickler had already done considerable
damage to Tegan�s derriere and legs, and she probably would not be able to show
up for the Pro-Life Seashore Jamboree at Atlantic City.

&nbsp;

�That would be a shame, as Tegan was known as
the Right Wing Hottie!!!!!!!!� Often fat,
sweating conservative pundits and congressional aides would flock to the
Jamboree to �listen� to Tegan lecture them on the evils of feminism and
abortion and the virtues of chastity, while wearing her black string bikini.

&nbsp;

Thinking of
it, for a moment, Tegan grinned. She thought of her leopard miniskirt that she
wore on the talk shows, condemning homosexuality, public assistance, Social
Security Disability, taxes, condoms, clean needle programs.

&nbsp;

Tegan enjoyed her trollop/nun combo�but she�d forgotten
that her beloved domme read the papers and watched TV just like everyone else.

&nbsp;

Miss Pratt seemed to be wandering dangerously close to
Tay�s full, now slightly welted asscheeks. You never knew with Miss Pratt.
During a previous session, she�d rubbed turpentine on Tegan�s clitoris and how
it had stung. So the Tickler might not be the greatest danger here.

&nbsp;

WHACK! There it came. But Tay didn�t cry. She would hold
back, as Miss Pratt hated whiners. �Besides, Tegan� WHACK! �you confuse gay
men� WHACK WHACK����������� �many of whom�
WHACK �are not known for long-term relationships� WHACK! �with us Sapphics, who
generally bring along a U-haul on our second date.� 

&nbsp;

Miss Pratt smiled with genuine joy as the Tickler made a
long, messy welt across the lower globes of Tay�s asscheeks. Miss Pratt reached
into the pocket of her sensible tweed skirt and pulled out a tube of Binaca
breath spray.

&nbsp;

�You�ve got to learn not to make sweeping generalizations,
hon.,� Miss Pratt said as she fell to one knee behind Tegan�s spread buttocks.
PSSSST! Spraying the breath mint directly into Tay�s pussy, Miss Pratt backed
off a bit as Tay screamed anew.

&nbsp;

�Does that hurt, honey?� Miss Pratt�s fingers began
exploring between Tay�s globes. She prodded and massaged Tay�s vulva, and the girl
began moaning. �I don�t mean to be too excessive of course.� 

&nbsp;

Tay began bucking and moaning as Miss Pratt continued her
expert massage on the young conservative�s clit. �You know of course, I�ve been
with my partner for twelve years.� Miss Pratt said mildly, pulling her fingers
out just before Tay was about to orgasm.

�But-but I respect your choices as an individual, Miss
Pr�� SLASH! WHACK! The Tickler began caressing with vigor, bouncing off Tay�s
bruised buttocks like Louganis on a diving board.

&nbsp;

Miss Pratt admired her own handiwork as the Tickler landed
seven or eight times, crisscrossing Tay�s pretty buttocks, and then suddenly
slashing between her legs where the Binaca had painfully disinfected.

&nbsp;

�But God forbid that I want to marry, eh�� Miss Pratt
shook her head, and tossed the Tickler on the floor. �So you�re not an
individual with choices, Tegan?� Tay closed her eyes but to no avail.

&nbsp;

Miss Pratt came over to the front of the horse and dragged
Tay�s hair up so that her head was bending backwards. Miss Pratt�s
bespectacled, homely face came close to Tegan�s classic features. �Jesus, you
beg to lick my twat again and again after every one of our sessions, honey.�

&nbsp;

�Miss Pratt looked
questioningly at Tay. � I remember when you were Republican counsel to the
House Ethics Committee, you used to call me and have me come see you so you
could take a muff-diving break between sessions.�

&nbsp;

Miss Pratt grabbed Tay�s scalp and she shook it. �And
Samuel tells me that you order a great deal of my glossies�pics of me in
various positions that I know you probably diddle to before you go meet with
Rush Limbaugh and Bill O�Reilley�.but are you a dyke in real life?� SLAP! 

&nbsp;

Miss Pratt�s hand left a nasty red mark on Tay�s cheek,
and her other hand let go of Tay�s scalp, finally. �Are you a dyke?� Miss Pratt
looked seriously at Tay.

&nbsp;

�You�ve told me about Olwyn, who was your lover when you
were roommates in the Senate Page program. But you were kids. And the slavegirl
who recommended me to you was whats-her-name Kulwitz, the Reagan speechwriter?
After your first session, I called her and she told me that she thought you
weren�t really gay, though you two had slept together�she said you were just
afraid of men. Is that it?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know, Miss Pratt� Tay gasped as Miss Pratt took
Tay�s nose in her firm fingers and twisted it firmly. �You don�t know? What do
you know? Think maybe you are always sounding off about other people�s
private�� here Miss Pratt twisted Tay�s nose viciously��lives because you
haven�t thought about your own?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t dow, Biss Bratt� said Tay through her mouth as
Miss Pratt�s fingers continued to pull and twist her nose. �I�be doo busy to
thick about byself.�

&nbsp;

Miss Pratt let go of Tegan�s nose and slapped her again.
�So you�re a lifelong spinster, as you told G. Gordon Liddy on the radio last
night? And proud of it.� Miss Pratt reached under Tegan�s head and twisted one
of the Jaws on Tay�s right nipple. �So proud�to look your best, dress sexy and
make everyone drool after you. You�re not a journalist, you�re just a miserable
little cocktease.� Tay moaned as Miss Pratt twisted some more.

&nbsp;

Finally Miss Pratt let go, and grabbed Tay�s jaw and
pushed her head up, and leaned in. �And you love telling people you�re an old
maid�you dress like a harlot, but you�re so goddamned virtuous. What a waste of
36C breasts, that�s all I can say.� Miss Pratt dropped Tay�s head. �And mine
are stuck in a� training bra for life.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, no, Miss Pratt, you have beautiful breasts they�re
quite full�� Tegan�s earnest rejoinder was rewarded by a slap right across the
mouth.

&nbsp;

��Don�t you have
anything better to do than look at my tits, you slug?� screamed Miss Pratt. �I
thought you were born-again, anyway.�

&nbsp;

.

�Miss Pratt finally unlocked Tay's handcuffs, and
the exhausted girl got up, and massaged her back and buttocks. &quot;Oh, God,
it hurts so much...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But
you haven't answered my question, dearie.&quot; Miss Pratt asked archly.
&quot;Why haven't you ever had a dick in you?�&nbsp;

Tay shook her head. &quot;N-no..I'm a
baptized Catholic AND I was born again last year. Being a virgin is--&quot;

&nbsp;

Miss
Pratt shook her head. &quot;No lies, darlin'. We know you're not TOO born again
because here you are, visiting me, right? I think the problem is, you need a
little bit of introspection. Possibly if you had a little experience with a
dick, you might stop babbling on your inane radio shows about how evil sex
is.&quot;

&nbsp;

Suddenly
the door opened, and Miss Pratt and Tegan, who towered over her while standing
up, looked over at Glynnis, who was still naked, but carrying a pair of
workmen�s overalls, stained with paint and grease.

&nbsp;

�Miss
Pratt, Samuel has taken my clothes and won�t let me have them back, even though
I told him you want me to leave.� Glynnis held up the overalls. �Samuel says
I�m to wear these out, but the dress he has of mine is a $4500 Gucci green
floral��

&nbsp;

Miss
Pratt snorted. �Shut your face, you ectoplasm. What, my father�s old overalls
aren�t good enough for you?�� Miss Pratt
looked up at Tay, who stood there dumbly. �You see the problem with you
conservatives..you turn liberal Dems like Glyn here into born-again preppies.�

&nbsp;

Miss
Pratt went to her toy box and reached in, selecting a copper coated welding rod
that Samuel had purchased for her at Home Depot. Miss Pratt walked up to
Glynnis.

&nbsp;

�What�s
a fat, repulsive hippo like you doing in a Gucci dress, anyway.� WHACK! WHACK!
WHACK! The welding rod left serious welts on both of Glyn�s shoulders. THWACK!
Miss Pratt landed a third slash right across Glynnis�s thighs.

&nbsp;

�I
recall overhearing that you paid extra for the dress to be made in your
size�but the overalls will look much better on you, Glynnis.� Miss Pratt swung
the welding rod again.

&nbsp;

��But if you insist on getting the dress back,
I must cooperate.� Miss Pratt went to the intercom. �Bring Glynnis�s� green floral dress with the silver diamond
beads, please, Samuel.�

&nbsp;

�I
don�t mean to be difficult, Miss Pratt, but the dress cost a lot.� Glynnis
said, relieved through her pain that the dress was coming back to her. �I have
to sell a lot of cook books, ha ha.�

&nbsp;

Tay
stared. Oh, she�d seen that woman�s face on the back of her Mom�s �Glynnis
Shepherd Italian Cuisine� book. Huh. Well, it takes all kinds.

&nbsp;

Samuel
came in, holding a paper bag, which he handed to Glynnis. �I was cleaning the
bathroom, Prattsie.� He said this to Miss Pratt with a concerned air. �When we
let Evelyn out of the Coffin, I put an enema in her and she had a nasty
accident in the Little Girls.� Samuel grinned broadly at Glynnis. �I was only
borrowing your dress, Ms. Shepherd.�

&nbsp;

Glynnis�s
eyes widened, and she reached into the paper bag and wrinkled her nose. Tegan
smelled it too. Oh, what a stink. Glynnis pulled out a light brown rag�no it�s
covered with fecal matter. But Tay could see a faint light green� color to one of the ends of the dress.

&nbsp;

Glynnis
dropped it. �You don�t want it, Miss Shepherd?� Samuel asked. �I just used it
to clean the bathroom a bit.� Glynnis looked a bit shaky.

&nbsp;

�Perhaps
you should put on the overalls and go home, dear.� Miss Pratt said kindly.
�We�ll see you next week, and maybe you can shave off the patrician attitude,
eh?�

&nbsp;

Glynnis
stepped into the filthy overalls and snapped them up, and staggered from the
room.

&nbsp;

Samuel
picked up the shit-covered designer dress, and nodding, left the room as well.

&nbsp;

�So
back on topic, dearie.� Miss Pratt said as she walked up and stared into Tay�s
face. Miss Pratt lightly swung the welding rod. �Why have you never had a dick
in you?�

&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&quot;Even
I've had a dick or two in me, and I've been a confirmed lesbian since I was
nine. Cut the religious bullshit.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No,
Jesus means so much to me...&quot;Tay babbled. WHACK! WHACK! Miss Pratt stepped
back and looked at the vicious red welts she'd just raised on Tay's breasts.

&nbsp;

�It wasn't easy to see them, as America's
blonde conservative Valkyrie was grasping her breasts and weeping, but Miss
Pratt could see real progress.

&nbsp;

Miss
Pratt decided to knock off the nipple Jaws as well THWACK! WHACK! The Jaws fell
to the floor, and Tay held her breasts and screamed, and then, after Miss Pratt
whacked her in the stomach, she threw up.

&nbsp;

&quot;Lick
that up now.&quot; Miss Pratt said warningly, and sobbing, the girl got on her
hands and knees and licked up her vomit.

&nbsp;

&quot;I
like these copper rods.&quot; Miss Pratt said.� And look, they're
flexible.&quot; Miss Pratt bent the rod into a ball and threw it in the
direction of the duct tape.

&nbsp;

&quot;Now,
dear. Why don't you tell me why you don't like dick...or have never tried
dick?&quot; Miss Pratt asked this gently. Tay began weeping. &quot;I-my Daddy
told me it was evil!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh
yes...your Daddy the Congressman who believes that abortion doctors should be
hung...I know about him.&quot; Miss Pratt said thoughtfully. &quot;Well don't
you want to be cured of this nonsense, honey?&quot;

&nbsp;

Tay's
eyes were drooling, and she was just beat. &quot;Wh-whatever you want, Miss
Pratt.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Well,
your break is over, back over the sawhorse, so I can cuff you up again!&quot;

&nbsp;

That
had been a BREAK? Tegan thought, as she wearily lay over the sawhorse once
more. As the handcuffs clicked on her wrists and ankles, she contemplated
suicide...but her clit was drenched. What would happen now, Tegan thought
excitedly.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�But of course you still have your values, right dear?�

Miss Pratt chortled. �Opposed to birth control, against premarital
dicks�but you must know how to suck a dick, don�t you?� Miss Pratt grabbed
Evelyn�s ear and twisted it. �Answer me! Can you suck a dick?�

&nbsp;

�I-I�ve never learned, ma�am�I was engaged once, but we were both
Catholic�� Miss Pratt began laughing. �Yes, good Catholic girls don�t give
head, do they? And you�re a born-again Christian on top of that, I understand
from one of your idiotic radio interviews. � Miss Pratt reached the Tickler
over Tay�s head while still facing her and slashed her back hard.

&nbsp;

So all you�ve ever done is eat fish�� Miss Pratt indelicately grabbed
her crotch through her sensible tweed skirt ��but you want to close all the
lezzie bars. Well, maybe you�re not a lesbian, but there�s only one way to find
out.�

&nbsp;

Miss Pratt blew a whistle, and a large African man, who resembled
Samuel, but was much younger, wandered in, unzipping his pants. As Tegan
screamed in horror, Miss Pratt lit a cigarette and� grinned. �Now you�re going to see the meaning
of true empowerment, Tay. Enjoy Kenseth, and give him something memorable!�

&nbsp;

From the �Washington Post, June 13, 2005�

&nbsp;

�In
a shocking but beautiful ceremony today, Washington pundit Tegan O�Kesen
married Kenseth Rajul, a Third World immigrant, who she now employs as her
chauffer. Although her family and former conservative friends boycotted the
ceremony,� the ecstaticMs. O�Kesen-Rajul,
now a writer for the socialist �Mother Jones� said mysteriously �Our greatest
wedding gift was being able to keep Kenseth�s nuts.� This reporter was unaware
that Mr. Rajul �s diet was vegetarian.�
