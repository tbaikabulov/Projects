Synopsis: A Romanian orphan girl makes the biggest mistake of her life...EXPORTED 
by ruthie[Phil] 
�Mishka, I think I'm going to die here � nobody knows where I am.� 
Mishka did not answer. Nadia hugged the rag doll to her cheek and wept in
  the near-black gloom. The chain round her bare ankle scraped on the ground
  as she carefully hid her worn-out companion down the front of her dress. Mishka
  had been with her since the Red Cross lady visited the Orphanage near Bucharest
  when Nadia was little. She had no idea how long ago or how old she was at the
  time. Nadia guessed she was about sixteen or seventeen now. Mishka was her
  only possession, her only friend. Nadia sobbed and chewed on a scrap of paper
  she had found in the corner of the room. Using her fingers, she had felt around
  every inch of the bare walls and floor as far as the ankle chain allowed. It
  was padlocked around her leg and to a heavy ring, which was bolted to the wall.
  There was a bowl with water, a slop bucket, and a thin blanket. This had been
  Nadia's world for the past few...days? But how long had it really been � without
  sunlight and no clocks it could have been much longer. There was hardly any
  sound, no light apart from the constant line under the big wooden door with
  no handle. When the man came to check on her and leave food, he was masked
  and did not speak. Nadia had given up begging him to let her go. She just cowered
  in the painfully bright light while he was there and said nothing. 
Nadia remembered the orphanage � how the poor food, monstrously cruel staff,
  and even the merciless bullying from the other girls were luxury compared to
  this! Oh why had she sneaked into the cab of the aid lorry? The driver laughed
  when he found her under his sleeping bag but had fed her chocolate and promised
  to give her a new life in the West. He kept her hidden while they traveled
  for hours through the night. She bitterly recalled the time they stopped in
  the middle of nowhere in the early hours of the morning. She had watched him
  through the cab window taking money from another man. He had counted it carefully
  then jerked his thumb towards the cab. Nadia shuddered as she remembered how
  the two strangers dragged her out and tied her wrists and ankles with rope.
  She would never forget the sack being forced over her head and being lifted
  into the back of their car. The sack did not come off until she was in this
  bare room and her ankle had been chained to the ring. 
She moved Mishka further up the front of her faded brown dress between her
  small breasts and wished she had more clothes. But this was the uniform at
  the orphanage � one dress and one pair of knickers each week. Her broken-down
  shoes had been pulled off when she was bundled into the car. Now the dress
  and her gray knickers were soiled and she knew she was beginning to smell.
  What was going to happen? Where were they keeping her and what for? Nadia had
  realized very quickly that she was in terrible trouble and was totally at their
  mercy. She hadn't been raped or abused but she knew it was just a matter of
  time... 
When the heavy door was unlocked and thrown open, Nadia knew straight away
  that this was different. She blinked in the sudden glare and gasped. Two men
  wearing black masks over their eyes came in and stared down at her. They were
  speaking to each other in what sounded like French but she only knew a few
  words and couldn't follow what they meant. They soon made things perfectly
  clear when the taller man knelt in front of her, slapped her very hard across
  her face and took the front of her threadbare dress in both hands. Blood began
  to trickle out of her nose and dripped on her chest. Nadia shrieked in pain
  and fright as he tore the thin cotton apart down to her waist, exposing her
  small breasts. Mishka tumbled out and landed on her lap. The man looked down,
  laughed cruelly and threw the doll across the bare room. Nadia whimpered in
  fear, watching him rip the dress right down through the bottom hem. Moments
  later, the ragged remains had been yanked down her arms and she was left cowering
  semi-naked against the wall. The other man punched her in the stomach then
  savagely took hold of Nadia's hair and dragged her up to stand. She cried and
  begged but every time she spoke or made any noise, she was slapped again. Barely
  able to contain herself, Nadia moaned and wept softly while her hands were
  forced together at her front. She felt hard things tightly gripping her wrists � metal
  cuffs. She couldn't free her arms! Nadia stared down tearfully while the chain
  was unlocked from her leg and more cuffs were snapped shut round her ankles.
  They were joined by heavy chain so she could still walk but only by taking
  short steps. Her hair was yanked back, cruelly forcing her head up. Something
  scraped each side of her neck. There was a harsh click and Nadia realized a
  metal collar was now locked around her throat! 
Nadia felt a chain being locked on the front of her collar then she was dragged
  along like an animal! The tall man spoke in faltering Romanian. �Carry dress,
  doll too! You walk quick!� He thrust the shredded brown dress and Mishka into
  her cuffed hands and pulled her along by the collar chain. Nadia tried to shield
  her eyes from the harsh lights of the corridor and shambled forwards in chains,
  clutching the precious Mishka wrapped up in rags. She was terribly frightened
  and ashamed of being naked from the waist up. All she had left to wear were
  the dirty gray knickers with their holed and frayed seams. They marched her
  down the long corridor past several bolted doors. She could hear crying and
  sobbing � more girls? At the end was a flight of steps. With great difficulty,
  Nadia managed to climb down to the bottom. There was a large furnace like a
  huge bread oven with flames roaring from the fire beneath. She was pushed closer
  to the fire door until the heat began to hurt her bare legs. �Dress, doll to
  go in fire! Do now!� The man pointed at her precious bundle then at the flames! 
Nadia gasped. No! Mishka � NO! She clutched the ball of rags tightly to her
  small breasts and shook her head. He jerked her hard by the collar and raised
  his fist ready to punch her hard. Fresh tears ran down Nadia's cheeks as she
  cradled the brown cotton with her cherished doll inside to her breasts. There
  was nothing she could do! Tenderly, gently, she parted the ripped cotton and
  stared down at her lifelong comforter. Choking back a sob, she softly kissed
  the doll's face for the very last time and covered it in the cloth. In absolute
  agony, she threw the ball of brown rags into the flames. Ohhh! Ohhhhh MISHKA!!!!
  The cloth caught immediately and curled away to reveal the doll's faded features.
  Nadia hid her face in her cuffed hands and stared in shock through her fingers.
  Her beloved Mishka seemed to stare back accusingly! The face began to smolder,
  blackened, and dissolved into glowing threads... 
The man brutally forced her hands down. He was shouting at her, pointing at
  her knickers. �Tear off...put in fire! Tear now!� Woodenly, Nadia took hold
  of the right side of her last garment and began to tug the knickers apart.
  Still shocked by what she had just been made to do, she ripped the seam open
  then tugged on the other side. The gray cotton came apart easily, as it was
  so threadbare and partly holed along both sides. Nadia drew the ruined knickers
  out from between her shaking legs and stared down at the tattered cloth. �Now!
  Fire...now!� The soiled gray cotton rags joined the rest of her only possessions
  in the fire. Nadia stared at the flames licking the smoldering cloth. Ohhh
  my poor Mishka! 
She wanted to scream, to rage at the wanton destruction of her beloved Mishka
  but she couldn't. All that came out of her mouth was a pathetic whimpering
  noise. They hauled her along past the furnace to a large room with white tiles
  on the walls and a stone floor. There were hoses and showers, and a metal bar
  at waist height with rings bolted into the ground below. She was pushed against
  the bar so it was hard against her back above her buttocks. The men forced
  her ankles apart until the hobble chain was taut then locked each cuff by more
  short chains to the floor so her legs were held open. When her arms were pulled
  up and over her head, Nadia whimpered in terror. She was being bent back over
  the bar! A chain from the floor to her wrists kept her painfully arched with
  her head staring upside down at the wall. She could her them talking while
  they removed their clothes! There was a buzzing noise then something hard and
  cold touched her body just above her private parts. Nadia squirmed in shock.
  They were shaving her pussy! She was totally defenseless and when she tried
  squeezing her thighs together they slapped her face hard. The men forced her
  legs wider apart with more chains around each knee to the sides of the bar.
  The shaving seemed to take ages! She felt their fingers rubbing her newly bared
  skin - it was horrible! 
Were they finished? One of the men had a hose with a rounded metal end. What
  was he going...? She shrieked as the cold probe suddenly rammed up between
  her legs and into her privates, tearing past her soft folds to ruin her virginity!
  The icy water began to swirl inside her belly, making her cramp in dreadful
  agony. The probe was pulled back out of her cunt but she could feel the end
  pressing up again... NOOOOO!!!!! This was too awful, too cruel! She wept and
  struggled while the pipe was twisted up her ass! Cold water cascaded out between
  her buttocks, flushing away all the filth in her bottom. Nadia cried in pain-filled
  horror but they responded by cruelly yanking her matted hair downwards. The
  other man roughly brushed her teeth upside down with strong toothpaste. She
  coughed and spluttered as the toothpaste ran into her nose, stinging horribly!
  Nadia moaned in anguish, unable to stop them from degrading her like this!
  How could they treat her so badly! 
The men finally took away the cruel pipe and freed her from the frame. But
  she was swiftly hauled across the room to stand unsteadily while they hosed
  her from head to foot with a high-pressure jet. As if to make the experience
  even worse, they used bristle brushes with disinfectant to scrub her clean.
  Nadia squealed in pain when her tangled hair was roughly washed and combed
  out under the cold spray. They took ages! By the time the men had finished,
  she was shaking and weeping but they had cleaned her thoroughly � inside and
  out! And all the time she could not get the awful image of Mishka burning out
  of her mind. Her only precious friend in the entire world � gone! When the
  men started to rub her body down with oil-soaked cloths, Nadia did not struggle.
  All possible resistance and protests had left her. She just stood in abject
  silence and let them move her body to whatever position they wished. The chain
  went back between her ankle cuffs. Her wrist cuffs were locked together and
  drawn up her back by a short chain to her collar. Nadia winced but did not
  make a noise while her hair was yanked and twisted into a tight ponytail on
  the top of her head. 
Something hard was being pulled tightly around her waist. Nadia tried to look
  down and caught a glimpse of a curved metal strap. It squeezed shut with a
  harsh click and hurt her belly. When she felt a hard object being pushed between
  her knees, she began to struggle again. The men were pulling it up, scraping
  it against the inside of her trembling thighs. Then she felt the pressure against
  her anus and up between her privates! Her frantic screams were ignored � Nadia
  was almost lifted off her toes as the laughing men yanked the cruel device
  upwards. She wailed in agony as her bottom and privates were invaded by cold,
  hard things! The pain was so awful that she barely registered the harsh clicking
  of padlocks securing the ends of the band to the front and rear of the waist
  strap. 
She was forced to her knees. One of men was standing behind her holding a
  cane just like Matron used to carry. The other man moved in front of her face.
  His thing was hard and sticking up. He gripped her ponytail with one hand and
  guided the throbbing tip towards her mouth - noooo! Nadia clamped her jaws
  but yelped as the cane made contact with her bare buttocks. The man in front
  pressed the end of his thing against her mouth. She tried to turn away. SWISH!
  The cane stung the backs of her thighs. AIIIIEEE!!! Again the tip of his thing
  pushed against her lips. This time she didn't twist her head away. It was awful
  - it was disgusting. Nadia forced herself to open her mouth. He pushed forward... 
Nadia knelt, defeated and used. They had made her suck them both until they
  squirted bitter-tasting stuff in her mouth. They had made her swallow it all.
  They had made her lick their limp things clean. She felt dirty and somehow
  older, as if her childhood had been stripped away. Without warning, they hauled
  her up to her feet. She was soon marched back past the awful furnace and up
  the steep stairs. This time she was pushed into a different cell, again in
  pitch darkness. Nadia stood listening as the heavy bolts were drawn shut and
  the footsteps faded out of range. 
Someone was in here with her! A low, desperate moaning noise somewhere to
  her left! Nadia got down on her knees and whispered very softly. �Please, please
  don't cry! Please � I'm a prisoner too a-and I won't hurt you!� The crying
  stopped. In the long silence that followed, Nadia heard the rustling of heavy
  chain and made out the vague outline of a figure in the almost complete gloom.
  It was another girl! 
A familiar voice stammered in the darkness. &quot;N-nadia? I-is th-that you?&quot;
