Cheryl\'s Box

Synopsis: Cheryl was proud of her achievement. Five years of hard work, and now it was ready. but, could she actually use it? 






At last it was finished, and ready to use, if only Cheryl could ever pluck up the courage to do so. she had spent three years designing it, and a further two years building it, in her basement, after work and at weekends.

But now. it was ready, and all the pipes and tubes glistened under the bright cellar lights. 

Cheryl had read about something on a story site some five years ago, and had wondered if it were possible to design a machine that could, and would, make it a solo effort, no-one helping or knowing what had happened. 

She spent several months working on the logistics, before even starting to work on the design itself. It had to be multi functional, and it had to be computer programmable. After all, once she stepped into it, control would pass to the machine. She really did have to make sure that there would be no complications, and that any program she put into it, would be followed accurately and precisely. If she was going to trust herself to the machine, she first had to trust the machine itself.

The only flaw, was that there could be no trial run. Once activated, the machine would do only what it was programmed to do, and, could not be stopped, not by her anyway.

As she looked at her perfected work, she asked herself again, for the thousandth time, if she really wanted this. Did she truly understand the magnitude of what she was planning? One mistake, and it would be a fate worse than death. 

But what of her mental state? How long would she stay sane in the grip of the machine&gt; how long before it drove her past all human limits? These were questions she could never answer, unless she submitted herself to her own creation.

The box holding the machine was eight feet high, and three feet square, which would allow her to stand inside it easily. She had considered making it a little narrower, but, she had finally decided to make it square. Not that it would help her in any way, it would simply be less claustrophobic for her when she stepped inside it.

Every night for over a week, Cheryl went down to her cellar and spent hours just looking at the machine. It seemed to beckon her, to scream her name, but she didn&#8217;t know if she was yet ready for it. Or if she ever would be. She knew, though, that one day, the machine would win, would claim her as it&#8217;s own. She had spent too long designing and constructing it for it to stand thee idle. She had already programmed the computer. All it needed, was her to step into the box, and the machine would take over.

It wasn&#8217;t as if she could test run it on someone else first. every single measurement needed for the machine, was set at her own measurements. There are no two people exactly alike, and the machine would not act the same with two different people. Pipes and tubes would not fit exactly on anyone else.

Cheryl&#8217;s only way of testing the machine, was to submit herself to it, and she knew this. It had been her plan all along to make it fit her only. And now it did. But had she wasted five years of her life?

She sipped at the gin in her hand, and stared again at the machine. She could, she supposed, check the inside of the box, as long as she didn&#8217;t touch the pressure pads. She could hold the door closed, just to see if it were too claustrophobic for her. 

As always, Cheryl was naked in the cellar, just in case she ever built up the courage to try the machine. She knew she was fighting it, but she had made herself a promise, that she would always be naked in the cellar, just in case a spur of the moment decision was made. She knew that having to undress first, would give her time to reconsider. When the time came, she didn&#8217;t want the time to change her mind.

Her glass was empty, and she was sure she hadn&#8217;t drunk it that fast, but still she needed a drink, pouring herself one, neat, and large.

So if she entered the box, and didn&#8217;t touch the pressure pads, she could hold the door closed, and see how dark it was inside. And how tight it felt around her.

Once again she sipped at her glass, perhaps a little faster than she had realised, as the glass was soon empty again.

Without thinking, she pored another gin, perhaps a little larger than the last one, but that was fine, Cheryl had been drunk many times in her life. The last time was at the Christmas Party, when she had snogged Bruce. It had gone no further, as Bruce&#8217;s wife worked in the same lab, and she had been watching. Had she not been, Cheryl would happily have had sex with Bruce. He was no Adonis, but he had rugged looks that attracted women, especially the lonely women like Cheryl.

Strange how the gin bottle seemed so light. Surely she couldn&#8217;t have drunk it all yet? Cheryl needed more. With another glance at the machine, she moved past it to where she knew she had another bottle of gin. Maybe it was a draught of some kind that she hadn&#8217;t felt, but the door of the machine opened as she neared it, blocking her way to the gin. At first, she started to close it, but then she had that urge again, to find out what it would be like to be in the box, but not activate the machine.

Slowly, Cheryl moved into the box, making sure she did not step on the pressure pads. These were shiny steel plates built into the base of the machine, if she stepped on them, the machine would activate itself, and Cheryl would be under it&#8217;s control.

Slowly, she began to close the door, allowing a slither of light to come through, as she held it open just an inch. Even so, it was quite dark inside, and she knew if the door was actually closed, she would be in pitch blackness. Not that light was needed for the machine, but she did prefer a little light, even at night in her bed.

Cheryl stood with her feet either side of the pressure pads, making sure not to step onto them, as she slowly allowed the door to close, leaving her in total darkness. The box, as she had guessed, did feel a little tight around her, even though she had room to move on all sides. It had to be that dark, as she didn&#8217;t ever want to see what the machine was doing, wanting only to experience it. But not yet.

There was a release button on the inside of the box, in case she had ever got caught inside it when she was building the machine itself, and now Cheryl moved towards it to open the door.

Although she could not see them in the darkness, the inside of the box held an array of metal arms, and a pole that ran from floor to ceiling, through the top of the box. Once activated, the metal arms would seek out her ankles and wrists, guided by heat sensors and photocells, the computer could instantly detect where Cheryl&#8217;s limbs would be, and guide the appendages to them instantly.

The photocells and heat sensors had been stolen from her own lab at work, though she had always told herself they were simply �on loan�. She knew, though, that they would never be returned, and had managed to cover up their mis-appropriation by false accounting.

So was her need to complete the machine, she had jeopardised everything. The box had become all consuming, often having to force herself to actually go to work, when she would have preferred to spend the time building the machine.

But, now it was ready, and she knew it&#8217;s capabilities, as long as she had programmed the computer correctly.

She moved closer to the door, searching for the release button, her fingers a fraction of an inch away from it, when she heard a faint metallic click.

Instantly Cheryl panicked. She extended her hand, trying to reach the button before it was too late, but she knew it already was.

She pleased and screamed for the machine to malfunction, but she knew it wouldn&#8217;t, and no-one would hear her screams. The box itself was three layers of wood, with foam between each layer, making it virtually sound proof, and the cellar would easy muffle what little sound did emerge from the box.

The computer kicked into life as soon as Cheryl&#8217;s foot had accidentally hit the pressure pad on the floor, the heat seeking arms already locating her wrists and ankles. Even before the first scream left Cheryl&#8217;s mouth she could feel the metal arms touching her ankles, the rings on the ends of the arms circling them, and clicking into place. Within seconds, even though she made every effort to avoid them, the second set of arms had located her wrists, and she felt the cold metal closing in place, before all four metal arms began to retract into the machine, pulling Cheryl into position, against the pole, pulling her ankles apart, and her wrists down to her side, preventing her from using them. A large metal ring encircled her waist, and locked itself into place, holding Cheryl tight against the pole.

Cheryl screamed at the machine to let her go, but even so she knew it was a futile attempt. The machine was purely a program, and could hear nothing. And now, the machine held her tight in it&#8217;s grip, a grip it was not about to relinquish, no matter how much she begged, screamed or cried.

From the floor she felt the telescopic pole pressing against her body. Two dildos had been fixed to the end of this pole, and Cheryl struggled to get away from it before it could impale her. but there was no where to go. The metal bands on her wrists, ankles and around her waist held her still, as she felt the cold metal pressing against her pussy and arse. The dildos were not over large, but they would fill Cheryl, and as they began to slowly press into her body, she began to scream again. She had never been anally penetrated before, and now, not only was her arse being penetrated, it was being filled to capacity.

Once inside her the dildos stopped, and the computer began its next program. Cheryl screamed again as she felt the dildos slowly begin to expand inside her. both were opening up from the tip, spreading out inside her, and making the dildos now hollow. But it also meant Cheryl would never get them out, as the small spikes began to dig into her flesh inside her body.

She had never felt pain like this before in her life, but the spikes now dug almost two inches into&nbsp; her body, from the inside. Only a doctor could ever release them, and there was no doctor on hand to do so. nor would there be.

From the top of the machine a metal helmet began to lower itself. This would fit her head inside, and hold it firmly in one position, and although Cheryl knew it would happen, she still tried to move away from it as it touched the top of her head. But there was no where for her to go, and the helmet slipped efficiently in place. The helmet covered the whole of the top of her head, and down the back to her neck line. The sides of her face were also covered, meaning Cheryl had no movement at all. The back of the helmet had a small but strong magnetic attachment, which locked onto it&#8217;s twin on the pole, pulling Cheryl&#8217;s head backwards, and holding it in the correct position.

She had not been able to discover what would happen if magnetic waves were sent through the brain, but had fitted several magnets inside the helmet, and when the time was right, the machine would activate them. This, Cheryl hoped, would stop her concentrating on the machine and what she had done to herself. To concentrate on what she had done, would simply drive her insane. But maybe the magnets would do that anyway?

Motionless, Cheryl knew she could do nothing about the next part of the program, as a penis gag came from the front of the machine and forced her mouth wide open. She tried to hold her mouth closed, but the power of metal over flesh was a losing battle, and her mouth finally opened to allow the gag to fill her mouth, before it started to inflate, filling her mouth completely.

Cheryl wretched and fought for breath, but the gag refused to move out, holding her mouth wide open. 

From the centre of the gag a thick plastic tube began to emerge, and Cheryl screamed silently as she felt it slowly being pressed into her throat. This pipe was essential, but the pain as it was forced deep into her throat was almost unbearable. Cheryl now wished she had built in some sort of pain relief, but that was not to be, as the pipe now filled her throat, and she felt the oxygen hitting her lungs. She wasn&#8217;t actually breathing herself, the machine was pumping oxygen into her, enough to allow her to survive. Nose plugs rose from the top of the arm holding the gag, and Cheryl ceased to breath of her own accord. The machine would keep her alive, and would breath for her.

Whether she actually felt the syringe enter her arm. Or just knew it would do and expected it, she didn&#8217;t know, but the syringe would deliver a constant supply of vitamins, proteins and other nutrients that would keep Cheryl alive, though she had no idea for how long. 

Still, she struggled to get free of the machine, but it held her firmly and tightly. Her one consolation, was that Cheryl had done a great job on it. The machine had worked perfectly, her designs a total success. But no-one would ever get to see it, she would never be able to boast of how well she had done, single handed.

She heard a small buzz inside the helmet, as the computer activated the magnets built into the helmet. Cheryl screamed into the gag as a fire of electricity flashed through her head, the magnetic waves going in several directions at once.

The machine would, indeed, keep Cheryl alive, though she would not know this. The damage caused by the magnets, continuously flooding her brain, would cause irreparable brain damage. She had knot known the effects of the strong magnets when she had designed the helmet, she simply hoped it would stop her concentrating on a single thing. She would not do so, now. she would concentrate on nothing at all. 

Inside the silent box Cheryl now waited. No longer the woman she was. No longer in control of her life. No longer in control. And eventually, no longer.
