Night School

�Now, if we examine the right triangle further, it&#8217;s clear that there&#8217;s another relation we can you to relate the lengths of the sides to the angle theta. The opposite divided by the adjacent gives what is called the tangent, abbreviated as tan.� Amy stopped, letting the class get it all down.

�Which one is opposite?� Larry asked.

�This one,� she said, trying to hide her frustration. �It&#8217;s the one not touching the angle itself, just as we saw for the sine function.�

�How are we supposed to remember these?� Jake asked. �Are there any real world applications for all this?�

�Of course. Trigonometry is fundamental to the use of calculus, and this is a pre-calc class. With practice you&#8217;ll find that there are only a few combinations and picking the right one won&#8217;t be hard. Besides, there are mnemonic aids you can use.�

�What aids?�

�Mnemonic. Just sayings that you can remember easily to help you remember things that are harder.�

�Harder,� Nick said from the back, snickering. Amy frowned. This was supposed to be adult education at the community college, not high school. Half these guys were older than she was.

�For instance, if you can remember sine, cosine, and tangent in that order, the order we saw them in class, then you can use the saying &#8216;Oscar had a heap of apples&#8217; to remember what&#8217;s divided by what. &#8216;Oscar had&#8217; means opposite over hypotenuse. &#8216;A heap&#8217; means adjacent over hypotenuse. And &#8216;of apples&#8217; means opposite over adjacent. Just look at the first letter of each word.�

�How about &#8216;Oscar had a hard-on over Alice?&#8217;� Benny asked. Half the class burst out laughing right away, and the rest followed after verifying for themselves that it worked.

�Where did you learn that?� she snapped. �It&#8217;s not really proper classroom material.�

�My bud Mike told me about it. He&#8217;s an electrician. Want to hear how to read color codes on a resistor?�

�No I do not!� she said, already knowing how that awful one went.

�Isn&#8217;t hard-on two words?� Larry asked.

�That&#8217;s not the point.�

�Yo, man, what if Oscar is on the bottom and Alice is on top?� Hector asked. �Then does everything get reversed?�

�Read the next section,� Nick said. �That&#8217;s probably what the cosecant, secant, and cotangent use.�

�Okay, okay, that&#8217;s enough!� Amy said, trying to get control. She preferred it when they were just bored. �Why can&#8217;t you guys be this animated for the normal class material?�

�&#8217;Cause there&#8217;s no dirty talk most of the time,� Dave said. �You&#8217;ve got to make it interesting, miss Howard.�

�With a gutter mouth? I don&#8217;t think so. What else would work?�

�If you took something off each time we get a right answer!� That came from Gene, and it was forward enough to make the class quiet, shocked at such a brazen comment. Amy was glad it was a night class and there was no chance of anyone walking by in the hallway outside.

�That might work,� Nick said, as the class grew more daring again.

�Okay, that&#8217;s it!� Amy snapped, slamming her notes down. �Pop quiz time. Take out a sheet of paper. Ten problems, which I&#8217;ll put on the board.�

�You gonna take your shirt off if we all pass?� Hector asked.

�Alright, here&#8217;s the deal. If the class average is ninety or better, I&#8217;ll teach the second half of tonight&#8217;s class completely in the nude. If not, you all agree to cease this line of discussion for the remainder of the course. Deal?�

There was a moment of stunned silence. Amy wondered if they would go for it. So far the class average had been seventy one for all quizzes, and those were announced in advance.

�Yeah, okay,� Larry said. The others began nodding in agreement. Amy erased the board and began putting up problems from the trig section of the book. 

�When you&#8217;re done you can begin the break period. We&#8217;ll start the second half of class at 8:30.�

She sat down as the eight men began writing their quizzes. It wasn&#8217;t a large class, but it was certainly the most trying she&#8217;d taught at the college. She was looking very, very forward to the day when she would get her doctorate in hand and start applying to tenure track jobs. 

Nick was the first to turn his quiz in. She began grading it on the spot and was annoyed, in a way, that he had a ninety percent. It was good that he was improving, but she wished he could apply himself that way all the time. Benny was next, followed by Larry, Vince, and Hector. Dave and Gene turned theirs in almost simultaneously, with quiet Frank finishing after all the others. As Amy quickly went through them she frowned and began to get nervous. Not that she would have to strip, but that if they got too close they might be pissed off at not making it and become even more unmanageable.&nbsp; But when Hector and Dave both got perfect scores her worry grew greater. Gene&#8217;s ninety didn&#8217;t help. Before she graded Frank&#8217;s, she stopped to see what the target score was. Frank needed a ninety five to put the average above ninety. He was not the best student, but as she went through one correct problem after another a lump formed in her throat. She could tick off a couple points for careless errors, as stated in the syllabus, but when she was done she was clearly looking at a ninety seven on Frank&#8217;s paper.

She gulped hard, and took a long drink of water. This was not good. But the students were gathering outside the door, and it was already 8:36. She finally called them all in.

�So, how did we do?� Gene asked.

�I&#8217;m returning them now,� she said. �I&#8217;m astonished that you all did quite well. Some of you had hundreds. It was very high, but the deal was for ninety and you managed eighty six. I hope that that performance was good enough to convince you to work this hard all the time. I&#8217;m puzzled, how did you all do so well this time?�

�I just used the Oscar thing. With Alice,� Hector said. �It was pretty easy that way.�

�Yeah,&nbsp; it was like, Oscar had, and over Alice, and stuff like that. I won&#8217;t repeat it. But we just did that for each problem,� Dave added. �That was some really good memory stuff.�

�Alright. Well, I guess if it works,� Amy said, reluctantly. �Frank, what are you doing there?� She saw that he had his calculator out and that all the quizzes were in front of him.

�Math,� he said quietly. �You told us how to find averages. It looks like we have over ninety after all.�

Almost at once they were back by Frank&#8217;s desk, looking at the calculator display. They turned to look at her.

�Hey, what is this?� Vince asked. �We had a deal!�

�Guys, it&#8217;s not like I can actually strip naked for the class.�

�Bullshit! You lied to us. What if your boss found out?�

�That I won&#8217;t disrobe for my class? I think he would be okay with that.�

�No, that you promised you would? How would that look?�

�Better than if I did it.�

�It would look unprofessional. They&#8217;d probably fire you. But no one would need to know if you carried out the terms of the bet. Why don&#8217;t you just take your clothes off like you said you would?�

Now Amy was worried. She knew he was right. Promising a strip show would certainly lose her the teaching spot. Another grad student could be hired on the spot to replace her. And it would get back to her thesis committee and the department chair.

�Come on, Miss Amy,� Hector said. �No one but us is in the building. We won&#8217;t tell a soul, you keep your job, and everyone&#8217;s happy.�

She slowly walked to the door and closed it. The windows were frosted, and wouldn&#8217;t show anything. She nervously began to unbutton her blouse.

�Quiet down!� she snapped before Gene could let out the hoot he was about to make. �No one hears anything. No one outside the room sees anything. You all behave with honor and don&#8217;t tell anyone. Let it be your secret that you take to the grave! Got it?�

They all nodded and quieted down. Amy&#8217;s cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she pulled off each item of clothing she had. Even her shoes and socks went. She realized, or her nipples realized, that it was cold in the classroom, being one of the rooms not well served by the old boiler in the basement. �Open your books to the section we were on,� she said. 

She began writing and lecturing, but it was nearly impossible to think. Her hands shook badly enough that she couldn&#8217;t even write the figures on the board, never mind the equations. After a half hour of feeling their eyes on her ass she couldn&#8217;t take any more.

�That&#8217;s enough. We&#8217;re letting out early tonight. Have a good week, everyone.� She made a beeline for her neatly piled clothes, but Dave was there with his foot on them.

�No way! We paid good tuition for this class. We want the rest of the hour!�

�You&#8217;ve never complained about getting out early before. Take your foot off my clothes, please.�

�That was our prerogative. We want the whole class!�

�I&#8217;m not prepared to do this for the whole class,� she said. �I can&#8217;t even write!�

�So?�

�Please, just let me get dressed now.�

�Not until ten!�

Amy became increasingly nervous as the men surrounded her. She knew she wasn&#8217;t in great danger to life or limb. That was a thing of the past during the last couple years, since the summer of ravishment changed the rape dynamic of society. But the danger of rape was very, very real. She knew many women, including female students in her department, who had been raped, sometimes more than once. They couldn&#8217;t stop it, and it was never even prosecuted.

�I&#8217;m not prepared to continue,� she said, her voice getting weaker.

�Maybe you could teach something else?� Larry suggested, running his finger down her breast. She slapped his hand away. He scowled and touched her again, poking harder. Vince poked at her hairy cunt. She squealed and tried to back away. This was not going to happen. She would not be gang raped by her own class.

She soon realized, however, that she had no real control left. The poking picked up its pace, along with slapping, pinching, and groping. Before her anguished mind could think of an exponential increase, they were upon her. When she ran for the door and they grabbed her tight and threw her down on her desk, she knew it was all over. They were loud, though not hugely so, not enough to attract the attention of anyone still in the building, if there was anyone. Amy, however, screamed her head off. Being fired was better than being gang raped, and at this point she could say anything about how it started.

Hector turned out to be the first. She screamed as he shoved his cock into her pussy and began a brutal, painful pounding. He was lying atop her on the desk, and her head dangled out over the edge. Someone shoved her forehead down, and she was suddenly presented with, from her visual perspective, an upside down erect cock and a set of balls dangling by her eyes. It went into her mouth, making her suck while the ball sack slapped her nose. She struggled as much as she could, but Amy was only five foot two, a hundred forty pounds, and not much for regular exercise. Most of her students were blue collar working men, strong and full of endurance.

She felt Hector cum in her and pull out. It was a grotesque feeling, having his cock replace by another one right away. That one finished quickly and vacated, to be replaced by a third. The cock in her mouth squirted what seemed like a quart of salty muck into her mouth. She gagged on it, but the cock was still filling her, keeping her from spilling it out. Someone was shouting at her to swallow. Fighting back the urge to puke, she did swallow. The cock left her, and she saw it was Larry&#8217;s.

She tried to keep count, but when the total exceeded eight and she knew they were returning for seconds her mind broke. There was no point in trying to keep track of anything. They were just going to rape her on that desk for as long as they pleased. She cried out in new agony when the first cock pierced her anus. The raw anguish was something she&#8217;d never even imagined. She&#8217;d thought anal sex must be like taking a shit, but it was incomparably worse. It was just as worse the next half dozen times they did it to her that night. Even worse was having to suck some of them after.

It was past eleven thirty when they seemed to agree by mutual consent that it was time to let her go. Amy lay sobbing on the desk as her students filed out of the classroom, reminding her that even if she filed charges, she&#8217;d still be out of work and marked by the press as an irresponsible whore for her encouraging behavior. She knew it was true. She lay sobbing for twenty more minutes. It was nearly midnight when she rolled over and stood up, only to find that her clothes were gone. Her purse and her briefcase were there, untouched. But not a single item of clothing remained.

There was nothing to do but walk out. She was utterly drained, degraded beyond anything she&#8217;d ever thought about. If she was seen, so be it. She walked down the hall, down the stairs, and out the front door, taking slow, shambling steps. It hurt to walk, and she walked bowlegged the whole way. 

The cold November air hit her as her wet body exited the building. Their cum was still wet all over her nude skin. Her car was on the far end of the lot, past many street lights and plenty of open area. She hurried across the cold pavement as much as she could and darted into her little car. She cried for ten more minutes before starting to drive away.

It was the longest thirty-five minute drive she&#8217;d ever done. When she reached her apartment building she walked&nbsp; in, again not bothering to hide. What could she do? If someone was in the hall, she would be seen, naked and cum soaked. She made it to her hallway and was walking to the door when she heard sounds behind her. 

She turned to see Sam Reynolds, a forty year old insurance salesman, staring at her. He had a good full frontal view of her semen ravaged and slap-reddened naked form, with her large swaying tits and matted pubic hair.

�What?� she asked, challenging. He hurried back inside. She unlocked her door and went in. She dropped her stuff, walked to the bedroom, and fell onto the bed crying. It didn&#8217;t matter that she was messy as hell. She cried herself to sleep and hoped against hope that somehow she could forget the disgusting ordeal had ever happened. It didn&#8217;t help that she dreamed about it.

The End.
