Synopsis:  Young couple meets at High School reunion and commits to a D/s relationship






BRITTANY
by slavegirl

�What the hell am I doing at my high school reunion?� Dave hissed to himself while pressing a nametag on his leather jacket. Bass guitar accompanied by drums boomed from the ballroom as he straightened his leather tie.
Purple and gold pompoms hung from the light fixtures. A purple banner with gold border and gold letters stretched the length of the far wall WELCOME TO YOUR 5 YEAR REUNION. Dave walked to the refreshment table. �Come on!� he said under his breath when he saw purple napkins on a gold tablecloth. Dave dipped yellow punch into a purple paper cup and scooped a handful of nuts into his right hand. As he dropped a cashew into his mouth he scanned the room. Blue pin stripped suits, sports jackets with slacks, bow tie and suspenders. Whatever possessed me to wear my black leather jacket and black leather pants Dave asked himself.
Dave was watching an entwined couple that looked like they were having sex when a strawberry blonde mane caught his eye. The dirty dancing couple blocked his view so he moved to the left. A cascade of loose waves down to a narrow waist appeared. Dave hoped he could get a glimpse of a face so he walked part way around the dance floor. Unexpectedly, a hand brushed the waves back to reveal a long neck. Dave focused on the wide silver necklace. �My God, that looks like a collar,� he said then wondered if he&#8217;d been overheard.
�Excuse me,� responded a voice at his right shoulder.
�I thought I saw my best friend, Colin,� Dave said still looking at the collar.
The dance floor cleared. Dave&#8217;s heart started to pound as he saw black spike heels flow into sheer black seamed stockings. His eyes stopped at the hem of the tiny black mini skirt. That&#8217;s got to be leather he thought. Dave dumped the nuts into his drink and placed the purple cup next to a pot of yellow chrysanthemums on a pedestal at the edge of the dance floor. He walked to a row of folding metal chairs behind the strawberry blonde waves and black mini skirt.
�I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing here,� Dave heard the full red mouth say.
�Relax, enjoy yourself. You might find someone who interests you,� her companion said.
Yes, that&#8217;s a collar, Dave confirmed to himself. He looked at her ring finger as she raised her left hand to drink from her punch cup. No ring there, but on the next finger she wore a thick silver square. He recognized the flat surface as a potential blank slate on which to engrave the word slave.
The band returned from a fifteen-minute break. Dave touched his crotch then strode over to the full red mouth. There was a swagger in his step as he anticipated holding that sexy body.
�Would you like to dance, Brittany?� he said looking from her nametag to her expressive oval eyes shaded by long black lashes.
�That would be nice.� She gave a hint of a smile.
Dave put his hand into the hollow of Brittany&#8217;s waist and guided her to the dance floor. The music was slow so he held her close and placed his cheek against hers. He smelled her leather mixed with a floral scent. Brittany flowed with the music, her pelvis rubbing his crotch. Was she sending him a message?
The band broke into a rock number. Brittany wrapped her body around his, pulled away, swirled back, and pulled away again. When he brought her back to him, she rubbed her right thigh against his crotch and moved her breasts across his chest. He had all he could do to keep from an erection. Without a pause, the band went into a smooth jazz piece. Dave drew Brittany to him while keeping one hand behind her back. As they moved across the dance floor Dave raised her right hand to the center of her upper back. Brittany placed her free hand around Dave&#8217;s waist.
�Ummmmm,� Brittany moaned into Dave&#8217;s ear.
He felt his cock begin to stiffen. He kept control. When the music ended, Dave released Brittany&#8217;s arm.
�I could use some punch,� she said pressing her body against his. At the refreshment table Brittany filled a purple cup with yellow punch. She held the cup in both hands, kissed the rim and said, �For you Sir,� as she offered him the drink. When Dave had taken the cup Brittany asked, �May I make one for myself, Sir?�
Dave&#8217;s heart pounded. �Not yet,� he said.
Brittany lowered her eyes.
Dave&#8217;s mouth felt dry but he managed to say, �Turn around slowly so I can appreciate all of you.�
Brittany curtsied and then rotated slowly before Dave. When she was facing him she asked, �Does what you see please you Sir?�
�Yes. So much so that you may get yourself some punch.� Man, am I glad I decided to make this reunion, Dave thought to himself as he watched Brittany pour punch. Those firm tits and tight ass are begging to be spanked. My leash is just what she needs, with one end hooked to her collar and the other end in my hand.
Brittany walked from the refreshment table to Dave with her head lowered and the punch cup clasped in both hands. Dave sat down on a chair, Brittany kneeled beside him. Dave&#8217;s cock throbbed in his tight leather pants.
�You&#8217;re fantastic,� he whispered into her ear.
�Thank you Sir,� she said.
My fantasy has come true Dave thought to himself as beads of sweat formed on his upper lip. His pulse quickened. �We don&#8217;t really fit with these suits and ball gowns,� he said.
�Where do we fit?�
�My place, with two glasses of chilled Chablis.�
�Give me your name, address, phone number and driver&#8217;s license number.�
�What?�
�So I can give Yvonne your ID information. If she doesn&#8217;t hear from me tomorrow morning she&#8217;ll call you or the police, whichever she thinks best.�
Dave pulled his wallet from his back pocket, removed a business card and wrote the requested information on the back. �Here,� he said, �hurry back.�
Brittany scanned the room for Yvonne then hurried to the other side of the dance floor. Dave watched her talk to her friend and point in his direction. I&#8217;ve got to go slow; don&#8217;t want to scare her off he thought. Shit, my cock wants to jump out of my pants and I&#8217;m telling myself to go slow.
�All set,� Brittany said moving her shoulder bag from one side to the other.
�What about your car?�
�Don&#8217;t have one. Living downtown and close to work, I really don&#8217;t need a car. I came with Yvonne.�
As they left the ballroom Dave smiled and waved to a guy he had played football with. He noticed a pregnant woman clutching the guy&#8217;s hand as he put his arm around Brittany and walked her to his car.
At the door to his apartment, Dave dropped his keys. Damn, he said to himself as he bent to retrieve them. Brittany&#8217;s legs were inches away under her mini skirt, but he forced himself not to look up. Until now he believed only artists created legs like these.
�Wow,� Brittany said walking into the apartment. She stepped across black carpet to the center of the room, then turned from the white leather couch, to the chrome lamp, to the glass table with a single red leather rose laying next to a pair of handcuffs. Slowly, she turned to the mirrored wall and saw the reflection of a picture over the couch.
Dave stood like a security guard. He watched Brittany as she took in the naked, bound woman suspended from a tree. He clutched his hands behind his back. Please don&#8217;t let her panic he thought to himself.
For a long minute Brittany stood with her right hand covering her mouth. Dave sensed her fear. Slowly she lowered her hand and Dave saw a smile spread across her face.
�You like this sort of thing?� she asked looking Dave in the eye.
�Yes.�
�I&#8217;ve seen pictures and read a couple books. Turns me on to think about being tied up.�
�Ever been spanked or whipped?� Dave asked as he walked up to her and took her hands in his.
�Never,� Brittany whispered.
�Yvonne has my phone number. Would you like to experience my toys?�
�Yes,� Brittany said demurely.
�I can&#8217;t hear you.�
�Yes, Sir,� Brittany said as she laid her head on Dave&#8217;s shoulder. He pulled Brittany to him to kiss her. She willingly surrendered.
From the coffee table Dave took the handcuffs and placed them on Brittany&#8217;s wrists in front of her. �So you don&#8217;t run off while I pour the wine,� he said.
When Dave returned to the living room Brittany was on her knees on the couch looking at the bound woman. He handed her a glass of wine, �To your new adventure,� he said raising his glass.
While Brittany sipped her wine, Dave got a magazine from his bedroom. �How would you like to be teased like this?� he asked opening the magazine to a picture of a woman tied spread-eagled on a bed with a whip being applied to her pussy.
A gasp erupted from Brittany&#8217;s throat and Dave heard her breathing accelerate. �I&#8217;m hot just looking at that picture.�
Dave turned Brittany to face him and unbuttoned her blouse. The silk dropped from her shoulders and she arched her back to project her breasts. Dave stroked two full breasts and kissed her neck just below the silver collar. �Fabulous,� he whispered.
�Thank you Sir.�
The nipples on Brittany&#8217;s breasts were hard and erect. Dave pinched them simultaneously. Brittany opened her eyes, startled. �I&#8217;d like to see all of that gorgeous body,� he said raising Brittany from the couch.
Without music, Brittany began to sway her hips as Dave unzipped her leather skirt. Slowly he slid the skirt down over her hips. She turned so her bottom faced Dave, stepped out of the skirt, turned back to Dave as she moved her pelvis front and back.
Dave could not take his eyes off her. She blew him a kiss and then with wrists handcuffed, unfastened one garter at a time, and slid first one nylon then the other down her long legs. As she rose up on her tiptoes she moved to him and placed her nylons around his neck. Dave&#8217;s cock throbbed and his heart pounded.
Removing the handcuffs he said, �Stand in front of the mirror facing me with your hands behind your back and your legs spread.�
Brittany obeyed.
As Dave viewed Brittany&#8217;s reflection he touched his crotch. This must be real he though to himself, I couldn&#8217;t be dreaming the scent of her perfume. The red leather rose fell off the table as Dave walked toward Brittany. He picked up the rose and placed the stem in her mouth.
�Hold this for me,� he said just before he stepped to the side to spank her bottom. His hand cupped each side of her butt after landing on target. With each swat Brittany&#8217;s ass grew warm and red.
Brittany moaned each time Dave&#8217;s hand laid into her. His breath came in rushes and he felt his hard nipples rub against his shirt. He answered Brittany&#8217;s moan with his own then placed kisses down her spine. He stopped at the small of her back to feel the heat. Before surrendering himself, he took command of his thoughts and again stood, self-confident. Methodically Dave removed his clothes, allowing himself time to take in the gorgeous woman who was so willingly submitting to him.
Then he remembered his new chair. When he had seen the red suede seat and metal back in the furniture store window, the chair had rekindled his desire to bind and whip a woman. Made of chrome tubing with a straight back that curved into a flat seat and curved into a flat foot for balance, the chair looked like an inverted question mark. Crimson suede covered the seat and was joined together down the back with eyelets and laces resembling a corset.
Dave attached his leash to Brittany&#8217;s collar and took her to the chair. With black rope he bound her hands behind the leather back just below the lacing and tied her ankles to the chrome tubing, which formed the balance foot. He let the leash hang between Brittany&#8217;s breasts.
Gently, Dave stroked Brittany&#8217;s exposed legs and abdomen with his red suede whip. Her thigh muscles were pulled taught by the rope and strained against her tan skin. With each breath Brittany&#8217;s abdomen trembled: first slowly, then faster as the whip hit with greater and greater force.
When she arched her back Dave felt like he just walked out of a phone booth wearing a cape. Her hard nipples thrust themselves at him as if to beg for more. He obliged by stroking her nipples with his whip. Sweat dripped from Brittany&#8217;s face to highlight red crisscross marks on her heaving chest. Her gasps of pleasure animated the marks on her body.
Dave&#8217;s cock stood erect, throbbing with anticipation. With his left hand, Dave cupped Brittany&#8217;s chin and rotated her face so he could look into her watery brown eyes. Each muscle in Dave&#8217;s arms knotted and his abdominal muscles clinched as he leaned forward to mesh his lips with hers. He kissed her again, feeling her dry lips turn moist. He thought her mouth felt fuller than the lips looked, fuller than he had imagined. He allowed himself the pleasure of enjoying a mouth unlike any other he had ever known. How would that mouth and tongue feel wrapped around his cock?
Brittany responded with a strong willingness, pulling against the ropes, which bound her shoulders and enhanced her breasts. She matched him kiss for kiss, straining against the ropes as if the bindings had released an uncontrollable lust deep within her being.
He&#8217;d never had a woman respond so eagerly to his ropes and whips before. And God knows there had been more than his fair share of women he had tried to get to participate in his fantasies. Now he wanted to rush ahead and at the same time pause to relish the moment.
Heart pounding, cock throbbing Dave lifted his warm moving mouth from Brittany. Quickly he released her ropes, lifted her from the leather seat and carried her to the lush carpet next to the glass table.
Brittany lay spellbound with nothing to cover her nakedness: no ropes, no whips, nothing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dave straddled Brittany&#8217;s body, his knees holding her thighs apart. He reached one hand straight toward her triangle of blonde pubic hair and pushed forward with a probing finger. She was ready, oh so ready, and only for him. He pushed his penis deep, deeper into her body. �Aah, aah, aah!� Brittany cried out, but he didn&#8217;t hear, for he had become deaf in his desire to have her. He could wait no longer. He succumbed completely to the flood that rushed upward, pushing, expanding, and hardening ever more until he burst inside her in quivering streams of lava that thrust a long groan of dominance from his lips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dave was still inside Brittany when he allowed himself to relax on top of her. He gradually became aware of the sight and sound of Brittany, her breath heaving and weeping in loud gulps. �I&#8217;m sorry,� he said, petrified with fright, �but I couldn&#8217;t stop. Christ, you&#8217;re the first woman to respond with such passion to erotic B&amp;D play.� Tears fell from Brittany&#8217;s eyes as Dave hugged her and caressed her hair. He kissed her all over her wet face and finally her weeping stopped. He lifted himself up to stand over her. �You&#8217;re fabulous, fucking fabulous,� he said dropping to his knees. He slid one arm under her head for support and pushed the hair off her forehead with the other hand as he began to kiss away her tears. �I didn&#8217;t mean to hurt you,� he whispered.
She threw her arms around his neck and looked into his worried eyes. �Yvonne told me I&#8217;d find someone who interests me tonight. She certainly was right.�
Dave lay on his side, holding his head up with his hand, and stared at Brittany. Her blonde curls draped over her cheek, down her neck, onto the floor. Her arms stretched above her head. Her nude body shifted, settling down until he heard the even rhythm of her breathing.
Flooded with emotion, Dave couldn&#8217;t sleep. He kept watch over Brittany. The house was quiet. Finally an amber glow from the morning sun filtered through the partially open blinds. The living room felt like an island with sunshine warming his heart. A ding from the phone on the table at the end of the couch shattered the moment. He answered on the second ring hoping not to disturb Brittany.
�Yes she&#8217;s here Yvonne,� Dave whispered, then frowned. �You want me to wake her so you can make sure she&#8217;s alright?� Dave got on his knees next to Brittany. He lay down next to her, kissing her, breathing in her fragrant smell, until he felt himself melting from muscle and bone to a stalk waving in the wind. He felt Brittany&#8217;s eyelids flutter in surprise against his cheek.
There was an awkward moment as he told her Yvonne was on the phone and wanted to talk to her.
Brittany wrapped her legs around his butt and touched the tip of his nose with her finger as she spoke to Yvonne. �Everything&#8217;s fine, really. I found someone who definitely interests me.�
Dave pressed against her, putting his arms around her chest, his hands cupping her breasts. Her body was yielding and when she stopped talking, she kissed him, long and deep, with increasing passion. He could not get enough of her, his arms wrapped so tightly around her that he could feel every rib along her side under his fingertips. He desperately wanted to push into her but he stopped, handcuffed her wrists to the leg of the couch. He retrieved two pieces of black rope and tied her ankles to the legs of the glass table. Her legs spread wide, he stroked her inner thighs paying attention to how she trembled under his touch.
�Oh, Brittany!� He shifted himself back to look at her. �Oh, Brittany!� He came almost as soon as he entered her, feeling the reeling dizziness he had that grad night long ago when he lost his virginity. She made a noise like someone letting the air out of a balloon, and then a groan. He pushed himself deeper into her, until he lay, heavy and satisfied, on top of her.
�Good morning,� he said, and they snuggled, Dave covering her with one leg, a hand draped casually over her breast, easily in intimacy, as if they had made love hundreds of times before. They stayed this way for what felt like hours, the golden light of morning shinning through the blinds. Eventually he sat up. �I know a great place for Sunday brunch,� he said.
�Ummm,� she said pulling against the handcuffs.
Dave released her and carried her into the shower. Warm water mixed with soap flowed between them, his mouth so hungry, his arms wrapped tightly around her. Brittany stroked his cock, and then lifted herself onto him. He began kissing her, first along her shoulder blade, then the hollow of her neck, then her mouth. Exotic pleasure rushed through him, urged on by the silky feel of her as he filled her up. His eyes half-closed, he saw her through a fringe of lashes, the soft cushion of her bottom lip, a vein tight along her neck.
The warm water rinsed their passion clean. Brittany dried Dave with a soft towel, gently caressing his back and legs. His nipples grew hard as she stroked them with the soft cloth.
Brittany dropped to her knees, �Do I please you, Master?�
Dave&#8217;s cock stood out from his groin. He held her face in his hands. �Yes, slave, very much.� He pulled her up and spanked her bottom. �Get dressed, but no underwear,� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brittany dressed in her clothes from the reunion. She felt vulnerable without underwear as she left Dave&#8217;s apartment, drove with him to the restaurant, walked down the sidewalk and through the automatic glass door. The hostess seated them without seeming to notice she had no underwear. The soft leather cushion felt cool on the cheeks of Brittany&#8217;s bottom as she pressed her leg against Dave. She fingered the silverware, thinking how the reunion had changed her life. Reliving the ropes and the whip against her skin her face flushed with the memory of her first climax only hours before. Would Dave want to see her again? Would sex ever be the same again? She pondered the question with dreamy eyes. Brittany watched the waiter take their order as Dave moved his hand up her leg and held her pussy lips between his fingers. He pulled and pushed, sending waves of heat into her body. She wanted to close her eyes, fling her head back and move her pelvis to heighten the sensation, but the waiter persisted in asking questions about their order. Finally, satisfied he had enough information the waiter walked to the next table. Dave eased two fingers into Brittany&#8217;s warm moist opening. She clutched the cushion while Dave moved his fingers up, down, around inside her. Sparklers flew as Brittany felt moisture flow between her legs onto the cushion.
Dave pulled her hands behind her back and turned her face to his. �You&#8217;re a messy girl. You&#8217;ll pay.�
Brittany&#8217;s heart fluttered. She said nothing.
As Brittany tried to chew the delicious eggs benedict, Dave held her pussy, and between bites used his free hand to pinch her nipples through her silk blouse. Every inch of her skin tingled. The table swirled into a blur under her plate. More warm wetness eased onto the cushion. Brittany couldn&#8217;t remember leaving the restaurant or the ride back to Dave&#8217;s apartment. Her body was hot and tingly, her mind reeling.
 Dave carried her to his bed, attached one end of the chain to her collar and the other end to a shackle at the head of the bed. When Dave was sure Brittany was asleep he assembled a rope of fine silver chain using pliers, silver solder and a soldering iron. He melted lengths of silver chain together around Brittany&#8217;s wrists and ankles as she slept. His cock hurt with desire as he joined the last link of chain on her ankle. �You&#8217;re mine,� he whispered as he leaned over Brittany&#8217;s pussy, reaching his tongue into her softness. He felt her pussy lips quiver and her clit throb.
Brittany moved her pelvis back and forth as Dave licked her inner lips then nibbled her outer lips. He pinched her clit, nibbled and licked, then spanked her pussy. She rotated her pelvis forward exposing her femininity to his feather light strokes. Little gasps of pleasure floated from her lips as each stroke hit harder... hardER... haRDER...HARDER. As Dave spanked Brittany&#8217;s pussy he reached his left hand under her back to grasp her right nipple. He continued to spank her pussy as he pinched one nipple and kissed the other.
�Please fuck me, Master, please,� Brittany cried.
�Beg or it,� he said in a commanding voice.
Brittany raised her pussy to meet each decent of Dave&#8217;s hand. He felt the tension in her body like a bow ready to release an arrow and heard the rush of her breathing.
�Please fuck me, Master, Please!�
Quickly he mounted her, thrusting his stiff shaft deep, deeper in her folds. She circled him with her legs and pulled him deeper into her. He pinched her breasts as he thrust in and out, in and out, in and out. He heard his moan mix with hers as his shoulders trembled and he collapsed on top of her. Soon she fell asleep and he spooned himself beside her, one arm holding her tight to him.
Dave closed his eyes. His mind raced, packed with visions of Brittany in bondage positions he had seen in magazines. His maleness longed to hog tie her as she slept, but his heart slowed his drive and he smelled the female essence of her warm skin, felt the fullness of her breast in his hand.
When Brittany woke she raised her hand to move hair from her eyes and saw the chain around her wrist. �What is this?� she asked, her eyes wide with wonder.
Dave kissed the back of her hand. �I placed chains on your wrists and ankles to show you belong to me.�
Brittany raised her foot to see. �Oh, my,� she said.
�Am I moving too fast for you?�
�No, I&#8217;m moving too fast for me.�
�I thought,�
�Ssshhh,� she said raising a finger to his lips. �Am I your slave now?�
Dave pressed against her, kissing her hard on the mouth. �Yes,� he joyously said.
�I have no experience as a slave.�
�I&#8217;ll teach you.�
During the silence that followed Dave heard the static air crackle, felt the tension of the sheets. Brittany lay motionless beside him, her eyes closed, her chin tense. Slowly her eyes opened; a smile formed on her lips. �When do we start lessons?� she asked.
Lying on his heart side, holding his head up with his hand, Dave looked deep into Brittany&#8217;s eyes. Her dilated pupils were calm, trusting. Dave drew in a deep breath, �When you are with me you will never wear underwear.�
�Yes, Master.�
Dave frowned, �I haven&#8217;t finished!� He slapped her breasts before continuing. �There are two signals you will obey any time, any place.� He paused. �Whenever I tap your shoulder you will immediately get on your hands and knees, expose your butt and wait. Whenever I point my finger to the ground, you will immediately fall on your knees before me, take my cock in your mouth until it becomes long and firm and ready to penetrate you.� Dave felt his pulse quicken. �Do you understand?�
�Yes, Master.�
�We&#8217;ll see!� Dave pulled Brittany out of bed and pointed his index finger to the ground.
She fell to her knees, bent over to him, opening her mouth and using her tongue. She was breathing hard. Drawing, pulling sensations made his shaft hot and thick. He put his hands on her head. Her tickling tongue was more than he could bear. He guided her head up and down his rigid organ. She tilted her head up to look at him.
�Do I please you, Master?�
�Yes slave, very much. Now finish what you started.� He felt a moist warmth enclose the end of his throbbing manhood. He groaned and arched his back. Her tongue searched the smooth round head, probed the small narrow opening, explored the texture of the skin. When her first actions brought expressions of pleasure, she grew more confident. She circled his organ with her tongue. He called out her name and she moved her tongue faster, ever faster.
He felt a strong suction moving up and down. �Oh slave! Yes slave! Yes! Yes! Yes!�
She drew him in until she nearly gagged. His cries and moans seemed to encourage her to try again, and again, and again, until he was rising to meet her. Then, his need for her was so great he tapped her on her shoulder. She hesitated. He tapped again. She got up, turned around and went down on her hands and knees. The sight of her round, firm butt and her deep pink opening, exposed and inviting, were irresistible. Before he could spank her butt he was entering her lush depths.
He mounted and plunged. The position made him feel pressures in new places and when he drew back, the rubbing and friction excited him in ways he had never before experienced.
As he hovered over her pumping and straining, he was suddenly reminded of the closing scene from his favorite video and he began to spank the sides of Brittany&#8217;s bottom.
She lifted up and back to him, matching his pace, moaning and crying, �Harder, Master, harder.�
The pressure mounted quickly; her words and his need drove him faster. �I&#8217;ll give you HARDER, slave,� he cried out. Holding her hips, and pulling her to him, he filled her. She pushed back to meet him as he surged into her with a shudder of delight. They stayed there for a moment shaking, Brittany&#8217;s head hanging down between her arms. Then, taking her with him, he rolled them both over on their sides on the floor. Her back nestled against him, and with his cock still in her, he curled around her and reached one hand over to cup her breast.
�I must say,� he whispered into her ear, �you are a very fast learner.� A sweet wave of pleasure washed over him. He withdrew himself from her pussy and led her into the shower. After adjusting the temperature he squeezed bath gel into his hand and began rubbing lemon-scented lotion over Brittany&#8217;s back and bottom. He loved the smooth slippery way the cream felt on her skin.
Brittany closed her eyes and felt his hands caress her.
He turned her around and faced her, taking time to gently kiss her, exploring her lips and her tongue, feeling her response. His cock had swelled and seemed to move on without encouragement, towards her. Dave had wanted a woman to respond to his whips and ropes and he had gotten her. Now a mixture of desire and apprehension overwhelmed him. In the middle of his thoughts he felt her small hand, full of bath gel, start under his arms, caressing with the slippery liquid, down to his hard nipples. She moved to his stomach and his thighs. With hands still soapy, she stroked his cock. He felt his excitement build, reach a peak, then explode in wondrous spasms. She lifted herself onto him. He felt her full passion enclose his member completely. At almost the same moment a high-pitched moan escaped his lips matched by hers. They held each other, wonderfully exhausted, as heat from the water seemed to melt the two of them into one. For a long time they stood under the cascading water, silent, content.
When they stepped out of the shower, Brittany dried Dave with a velvety soft towel. As she reached his shoulders, she looked into his eyes, �May I make dinner for you Master?�
�There&#8217;s not much in the cupboards.�
�I&#8217;m creative.�
In the kitchen, the evening light cast delicate shadows on Brittany&#8217;s naked stomach and thighs. Dave couldn&#8217;t take his eyes off her as she cooked spaghetti and tossed a salad. Each time she came to the table where he sat, he wrapped his arms around her waist and nibbled her nipples. It seemed to him she made many more trips than were necessary. Each time carrying only one plate or one piece of silverware, but he said nothing to change her pattern. He sat on his chair as she placed the bowl of spaghetti in the center of the table. �Kneel,� he said.
Brittany obeyed.
Dave spooned spaghetti onto his plate. He picked a piece of tomato out of the salad and placed the round slice in Brittany&#8217;s mouth. �Don&#8217;t eat until I tell you.�
On her knees, Brittany&#8217;s chin touched the edge of the table. She kept her back straight, her mouth slightly open with the tip of the tomato protruding past her lips.
After Dave ate several forkfuls of spaghetti rolled onto his fork, he looked at Brittany. �You may eat.�
After she had chewed and swallowed the tomato, Dave slid a long string of spaghetti into her mouth, leaving a tail hang down to her chin. �Don&#8217;t let that move.� Dave chewed every bite one hundred counts. He didn&#8217;t want either the evening or the weekend to end. Each sip of tea he held in his mouth, savoring the delicate taste before swallowing. Finally he brought his eating ritual to a finale. �Swallow,� he said to Brittany. She obeyed.
�Time to end this wonderful adventure,� Dave said. �We both have to work for a living. Get dressed�
Wearing clothes from the reunion minus underwear that she had stuffed in her handbag Brittany didn&#8217;t want to leave but knew there was no other practical choice.
When Brittany returned to the living room Dave pointed to a note pad. �Write your name, address, phone number and work location,� he commanded.
Taking her time Brittany did as instructed.
During the drive to Brittany&#8217;s apartment, Dave pressed her left thigh against his right with his free hand. In the quiet of the car he heard her breathing, felt the tension in her body. He could have sworn she was trembling. Oblivious to the traffic, Dave realized he had longed for a slave his entire adult life and had been granted his wish for one wonderful, glorious weekend. What was happening now was what always happened whenever a desire was granted. He wanted more.
At the door to Brittany&#8217;s apartment Dave pressed against her, putting his arms around her waist, hugging her to him. He kissed her, long and deep, until he could barely breathe. Slowly he pulled away, held her at arms length, looked into her watery eyes, �I&#8217;ll call you.� He turned and slowly walked away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once inside her apartment Brittany removed her clothes, heavy with Dave&#8217;s scent. She took them to bed with her. Exhausted she fell into a sound sleep. When the alarm went off Brittany wasn&#8217;t ready to get up. She caressed her blouse, enjoying Dave&#8217;s remaining smell. Not wanting to answer questions about the wrist and ankle chains, Brittany dressed in a pants suit. She ambled to her office a mile away from her apartment. 
Despite meetings, reports and employee evaluations, hours passed like weeks for Brittany. Every time the phone rang she expected to hear Dave&#8217;s voice. He didn&#8217;t call. By the end of the day she decided Dave had been displeased with her. Still, tied to a thin rope of hope, she removed her bra and panties and stuffed them in her purse. Pushing through the front door of the building she saw Dave leaning against the hood of his Z-3. She ran to him. Seated beside him, her heart pounded in her chest, sweat dripped between her legs.
He picked up a red rose from the dash, "For my slave," he said.
Brittany swallowed hard. �Thank you, Master,� she whispered.
�I can&#8217;t hear you.�
�Thank you, Master,� she said in a fuller voice.
�Did you think about me?�
�Think about you! I haven&#8217;t been able to get you off my mind all day.�
Dave reached his hand to feel her moist pussy tremble to his touch. He reached inside her blouse and pinched her hard nipples. Her soft gasp told him unequivocally that she had indeed been thinking about him all day.
Back in Dave&#8217;s apartment, just inside the entry, he pointed his index finger to the ground. Brittany immediately fell to her knees before him. She unzipped his pants, gently removed his cock and kissed the tip before taking his full member in her mouth. Her up and down pulling motions made his shaft hot and thick. She placed kisses along the length of his cock and her cool lips against his warm skin sent quivers up his spine.
With both hands he lifted her head, freeing her mouth, and led her to the coffee table. He stripped her, and then laid her face up on the table. Separating her long hair into two hanks, he wrapped each one around a leg of the table twice. To secure her head he knotted the remaining ends of hair. He spread her legs and tied her ankles to the other table legs with golden rope.
�I told you that you would pay for being a messy girl,� he said tickling her pussy with the tips of his black leather whip.
As the whip moved up her quivering stomach, her nipples grew hard. He brushed the tips of his whip over and around her breasts and along her neck. He reached down to kiss her and felt the heat of her body. With slow deliberate motion he struck her legs, swirling his whip in the air before each hit. At her pussy he rotated the whip so each end laid into her moist folds. He hit with sure flat strokes over her stomach, leaving straight red marks. At her breasts, he returned to her legs to begin the process once again. Each time he reached her pussy she raised her throbbing femininity to meet his leather straps.
Darkness crept into the apartment as his whip danced up and down her body. She sang out with pleasure each time his whip landed on her skin. She made feeling guilty impossible. No matter what the stimulation, she was there for him, an active willing partner.
The heat of his body matched hers. He could hear her heartbeat. He wanted all of her, all at once. He took her mouth, drew her tongue into his. His hand caressed her stomach, her hip, her leg, then reached for her hot inner thigh. He cupped his hand over her pussy and felt a sudden dampness.
Gently he laid the red rose between her breasts, down her chest. The jolt of his cock surprised him. His member throbbed impatiently as he swung his leg over the table. She arched up to receive him; he let himself enter. He felt his lungs drawn in deeply, her warm moist depths embracing him. He drew back and plunged deeply into her, withdrew and penetrated once more.
For an instant his throaty cries harmonized with her breathless sobs as uncontrolled pleasure shuddered through them. Then, with gratifying release he collapsed on top of her, feeling thorns pierce his skin. Sweet smells encircled his head. He didn&#8217;t want to move, didn&#8217;t want the experience to end; though he knew the moment was over.
As they relaxed, entwined on the couch, he stroked her hair. Reluctantly he retrieved wine cheddar cheese and wheat crackers from the kitchen. Sitting together they talked until one in the morning. Tomorrow she would move in with him, just a trial. There wouldn&#8217;t be much because she would still keep her own apartment. After work they&#8217;d move her clothes, some books.
Each day Dave drove Brittany to work and picked her up. They experimented with positions: hog-tied, suspension, spread eagle. Each evening brought a higher level of passion to their play.
On the Saturday morning of their second weekend together, Brittany eased out from under the comforter so as not to disturb Dave. She crept into the kitchen to make cappuccino, the ropes around her waist, through her pussy constricting with every step. Dave had shaved her pussy the night before; the ropes cut into her naked flesh. The rope around her back, bound her breasts so they stood out from her chest like firm globes. Her movement made them bounce.
Brittany had difficulty concentrating on her task, but she was determined to surprise and please Dave. At last she carefully carried two cups of cappuccino on a tray into the bedroom. Dave had begun to stir, and the strong smell of coffee aroused his senses enough to lift him out of the pillows.
Quickly she kneeled beside the bed, raising the tray over her head. Dave smiled, lifted a cup to his mouth, leaving a film of whipped cream. �You may join me, slave.�
Brittany licked the cream from Dave&#8217;s lips before drinking from her own cup.
He pulled on the ropes between her pussy and around her chest. �This is by far your sexiest outfit.�
�Thank you, Master.�
After sipping cappuccino and cuddling, Dave removed Brittany&#8217;s ropes. Pink indentations remained. His fingers touched the impressions and he felt pride in his artistry. He forced himself to move away from her. He planned to implement an idea he had the night he met her, and to do this he had to be out of bed. He pulled an aqua spandex mini dress and white leather spike heels from the closet. �Wear these,� he said.
Brittany took the clothes into the bathroom. Dave watched her sponge eye shadow and brush mascara to accent her glittering eyes. As she pulled the spandex dress over her firm bottom, onto her breasts the fabric became a stretchy, slinky second skin and Dave's cock climbed to his belt buckle.
�We&#8217;ve got important business to take care of,� he said placing Brittany&#8217;s silver collar around her neck.
At the Empire Mall, Dave escorted Brittany to the jewelry store. �Give me your ring,� he said.
Brittany removed the thick silver square from her left hand and gave the ring to Dave. Her head bowed. His legs quivered as he turned to the jeweler. �I&#8217;d like to have the word slave engraved on this ring.�
The jeweler blushed. �I would suggest a fine script for such a beautiful possession, sir.
Dave heard Brittany&#8217;s breathing, felt sweat on his temples. �I was thinking more in terms of bold, square letters.�
�We can do that, of course. Take about an hour,� the jeweler said writing up the order. Dave paid in full. �In an hour,� Dave said over his shoulder as he escorted Brittany to the promenade.
After they strolled through the shops on both sides of the public walk, Dave sat on a stone bench next to a pond. Brittany stood before him. �I want you to walk down to that metal sculpture, around the far potted fern and back to me,� he said. She turned to leave and Dave grabbed her hand. �Not too fast. I want to enjoy the show.�
Brittany hesitated, pulling on the hem of her dress. She&#8217;d never been on display like this before, and she wasn&#8217;t sure she liked the idea, but she wanted to please her Master.
Dave patted her bottom, �Now,� he said.
As she walked away, Dave watched the two ovals of her bottom oscillate up and down under her second skin. He smiled, as her taut curvy body became the center of attention in that tight-tight, sexy dress. When she turned to face him for the return walk, Dave struggled to control his manhood. Every male eye was on his slave. His heart pounded with such force he felt bursts in his chest. To calm himself, Dave checked his watch. Time to pick up the ring. He met her at the sculpture. Her shoulders were tense and she wouldn&#8217;t look him in the eye. He took her hand in his. Together they walked back to the jeweler where Dave slid the silver square onto Brittany&#8217;s trembling finger.
Sitting next to Dave on the drive back to his apartment, waves of excitement coursed through her. How did he know her so well when she didn&#8217;t know herself? She felt a warm wet tingling between her legs, and wondered what Dave would do when they arrived in the apartment.
She didn&#8217;t have to wait long. Just inside the door he stripped her then tightly wrapped rope around her wrists, down her arm to hold her arms snugly together over her head. She was breathing hard. He wrapped more rope securely around her waist, over her hips, down her legs. He hung a block and tackle to a screw eye in the living room ceiling then attached a quick-release hook to the ropes at her wrists. He lifted her off the floor where she slowly rotated before him like a cocoon, her breasts ripe for whipping. He stood back to look at her reflection in the mirrored wall. He glanced from Brittany to his picture of the bound woman suspended from a tree. �Now I&#8217;ve got a matched set,� he said. He reached up to her breasts, pinching each nipple. She moaned with pleasure. Shivers shook her.
His cock had grown, and pushed intently against his pants. He eased her down to the floor and untied the ropes from her waist down. He kissed her mouth, then ran his warm tongue down the middle of her throat, between her breasts, down to her navel. He spread her legs, moved between her thighs and pushed into her. She cried out and he felt himself surge again and again. They climaxed together lying spent under the picture of the bound woman.
He held her for a moment, then let go. �It turns me on to think about you taking your underwear off before you leave work.�
She rolled over on her side and smiled, �Being naked for you pleases me too, Master.�
He thought about the fun they had been having after a long workday. He relished stripping her, except for her heels and collar then directing her with his whip through the dinner preparations. Just thinking about her kneeling beside him with her hands behind her back while he feed her turned him on. Dave stood up and pointed his index finger to the ground and Brittany struggled to get on her knees. He tied her arms over her head. He let her struggle to maintain her balance. He ran his fingers down her legs. She pleaded for mercy. When he was satisfied she had endured enough, he unwrapped her arms and took her to bed. He kissed her neck and her mouth then he attached one end of a chain to a shackle at the head of the bed, the other to her collar. He fondled her breasts. Suckled her nipples. He loved touching her body for the feelings her softness aroused within him. He wanted to prolong each experience, keep himself controlled longer, but he found the small cries that escaped her lips aroused him more than before. They came together almost instantly.
Dave ordered Chinese take out. When the delivery guy knocked on the door Brittany answered in only her black suede platforms. Dave watched from the side. The guy&#8217;s mouth dropped open. Brittany handed him two twenties. His mind couldn&#8217;t coordinate with his hand to take the money. Brittany gently stuffed the bills in his pocket before taking the white paper bag containing food. �Thanks,� she said then kissed him on the cheek.
Brittany placed the bag on the floor before flinging her arms around Dave and kissing him. They laughed reliving the delivery guy&#8217;s reaction to Brittany&#8217;s nakedness. He led her by the hand to the table. She kneeled beside him and waited to be fed. 
�Tomorrow is another work day. Let&#8217;s get to bed,� Dave said. Exhausted, he spooned himself behind Brittany, placed his hand on her naked mound and drifted off to sleep.
In the morning Dave realized Brittany was becoming an important part of his life. He spent every free second devising ways to stimulate her and thereby, of course, pleasing himself. During the week he formulated a plan. Late Saturday the rental company delivered a mini van equipped with a DVD player and screen on which he could play Nine and a Half Weeks. While Dave went downstairs to accept the vehicle Brittany was alone in the apartment for the first time. She pinched her nipples to assure herself she was not dreaming. The life she was living was real.
When Dave didn&#8217;t return in fifteen minutes Brittany retreated to the kitchen to reheat rotisserie chicken with vegetables from Friday&#8217;s dinner. As she set the table she heard the door open. He found her in the dining room. 
�You may sit at the table for this meal,� Dave said.
�Yes Master.� Brittany took the chair to Dave&#8217;s right. �We have pecan pie for dessert. Perhaps we could use the balcony.�
�Certainly,� Dave agreed. 
The evening felt balmy. Stars clustered in the clear blue sky, and the full moon seemed to smile down at him. He and Brittany had just finished their pie. Gently he lifted her from her kneeling position beside him and with her facing him he draped blue rope around her neck. He threaded the long ends between her pussy lips, pulled them straight up her back, and knotted them to the rope behind her neck. He wrapped her breasts tight, leaving her nipples exposed, and tied each side off in the middle of her back like a bra.
�We&#8217;re going out,� he said placing a long black satin cape over her shoulders. He guided her to a black mini-van he had rented especially for the occasion. He drove the van to an empty parking lot, stopped the engine and shifted to the floor behind Brittany.
�Spread your legs and put one foot on each side of the seat.� Brittany obeyed and Dave tied her ankles together across the back of the seat. �Now your hands.� Brittany placed her hands behind the seat and Dave tied them together. Her palms were sweaty from anxiety. He returned to the driver&#8217;s seat.
They drove through residential neighborhoods, past a shopping mall to a wooded park. He heard Brittany whimper but concentrated on choosing a parking space under a tree. Their eyes met. �We&#8217;re going to the movies,� he said. He reached behind his seat and pulled out a canvas bag. �I brought some toys.�
Brittany smiled.
Dave pulled down the screen and activated the DVD. In the glow from the illuminated screen Dave swiveled Brittany&#8217;s bucket seat so she faced him and unhooked her cape. Her body was tense, her nipples hard, her pussy moist. Dave pushed a ball gag into Brittany&#8217;s mouth.
She shook her head no.
He kissed her cheek. �It&#8217;s OK,� he whispered then rotated her seat to face the activated screen.
The movie had already started so she stared straight ahead. The picture on the screen seemed to blur. She blinked, tried to focus but her mind swirled with both fear and excitement. Her mind raced to grasp her feelings. What if someone walked by and saw her? What if Dave drove out of the park, onto the streets with her sitting like this? She felt her pussy quiver. Warm spasms flowed from her pelvis to her abdomen. She felt her wrists and ankles being untied. Then two warm hands moved her to a place in the center of the van. Her cape was off and the metal floor felt cool against her nakedness. Her ankles and wrists were retied. She heard Dave&#8217;s low soft voice behind her, �Oh Brittany, my darling, my beautiful slave.�
Dave knelt down in front of her. He had something in his hand, but she couldn&#8217;t tell what. Suddenly she felt a sharp squeezing force, like a pinch, on her pussy lips, followed immediately by another and another until she counted six separate pinches. A dull ache flowed into a flaming pain.
�One clothespin on each nipple and we&#8217;ll be done,� she heard Dave say as she felt teeth bite her nipples. Tears streamed down her cheeks. She cried out, but the gag muffled her sounds.
She focused on Dave. He was smiling, and his hands were brushing against the clothespins on her pussy and her nipples, sending hot spasms through her body. She arched her back, lifted her pussy. Small climaxes, one after another, vibrated through her being.
A freezing cold touched her lips drawing heat from her body. The coolness trailed down her neck, between her breasts to rest on her navel. A pool of water formed, dribbled down her sides. Her spasms melted with the ice. She felt weightless, like a balloon floating higher, ever higher out of sight.
Dave heard a car pull in to the parking lot. His rock hard cock stood out from his pants. He tried to push the bulge down. No luck. The screen was black. He inched his way to the driver&#8217;s seat. His hands shook as he started the engine. He felt the cold steering wheel against his stiff organ as he backed out of the parking space. He wanted her more than he had ever wanted her before. Why did that damn car have to pull into the park?
Lights spun by. A rocking motion made Brittany&#8217;s clothespins sway. She was losing herself again. She tried to concentrate. The sharp squeezing force had turned to a dull ache.
Dave pulled into his garage. Closed the automatic door. Immediately he removed the gag, released her ankles and wrists. She was laying on her back on the floor of the van. Dave was over her. His eyes held only trust and desire. Brittany lay still, not moving a muscle yet shaking. His eyes seemed to touch deep inside her. She had never been so aroused. She ached to be satisfied.
�My Master, I need you. I need...� she cried out to him.
He entered her, drew back, plunged deeper into her again, and again and again. Each time he filled her, she was conscious only of him. Then the pressure broke with vibrant eruption and dispersed through her body with energetic release. She watched him lift off her, smiling up at him. �I&#8217;d better get us upstairs,� he said.
A week later Dave and Brittany were watching the Story of O. As the final scene faded Brittany looked into Dave&#8217;s eyes. �We&#8217;ve been together exactly one month today,� she said.
Dave couldn&#8217;t believe how quickly the time had passed, how complete he felt. �I almost didn&#8217;t go to that reunion.�
�Yvonne dragged me there too.�
He put his arm around her and kissed her, barely touching her lips with his. He felt her tingling response. He gathered her up in his arms. She was aware of his strength as he carried her into the dining room. He laid her on her back on the table and tied her wrists and ankles off to chairs so she looked like a voluptuous x. He lit a tapered red candle, raised it high above his head and let the wax drip onto her breasts, making circular designs. He kissed her open mouth, then buried his face in her neck. Breathing hard, he backed off to see the red droplets on her sensuously contoured skin.
Taking a deep breath, he lit a black candle, and zigzagged hot wax across her thighs and stomach. Dave ginned. She was whimpering with delight and her mound was raised up. He caressed the side of her body, feeling the contrast of hot and cold.
She flinched when he dropped white on her femininity. He let the hot wax trickle until her pussy was completely encased.
�I feel hot stings all the way through me,� she said.
He looked down at her. He kissed one eye closed then the other. He kissed the tip of her nose. Then her mouth. Then both nipples. She opened her eyes and smiled and he showed her the wide silver blade glistening in his hand.
Sensing her anxiety, not the fear he had anticipated, he slowly, carefully lifted the wax off her breasts, then her thighs and stomach. At her pussy he gently removed the wax to see her clit standing at attention. He kissed each area after he wiped it clean. He released her bonds and she sat up. He filled two glasses with champagne, handed one to her. The tinkling of glass reached his ears as he said, �As a test of our commitment, we must separate. No phone calls, no dinner meeting. No contact whatsoever for a week.� He set down his glass without taking a sip.
What was he saying? Where had this idea come from? He was happier than he had ever been in his life. He had a devoted slave, so why was he sending her away?
This certainly was not what she expected when he handed her the glass of champagne. Her mouth trembled when she spoke. �What have I done to displease you Master?� She waited, not thinking, only anticipating, she did not know what.
He clinched his hands into fists, looked into her watery eyes. �You please me very much, but I have to know you want this as much as I do.� He set his glass down.
�Please don&#8217;t send me away,� she cried. �Please, Master. Don&#8217;t send me away.� She put the glass of champagne on the table.
He removed her silver collar, slave ring, both the chains around her wrists and ankles, and dropped them in a pile on the table. He ignored her sobs. �The discussion is over,� he said.
Brittany gathered her clothes. Dave packed them in his car and drove to her apartment. They sat apart, not saying a word. Without looking at her, he carried her things upstairs. As he turned to go Brittany grabbed his hand. He faced her. He wanted to kiss her, tell her everything would be all right, but he didn&#8217;t dare. In a hoarse voice he said, �I&#8217;ll contact you when the week is up.� He backed away without touching her.
She wanted to cry out, but the sounds caught in her throat.
What had he done? He wanted her. Not as a memory in his mind, but flesh and blood beside him. Every minuet of every day she took over his mind. He saw her long blonde curls at the gas station, in the hardware store, in the office where he worked. Her smile, the way she tilted her head, her swaying walk invaded his thoughts when he tried to concentrate on his computer programming. His nights were torture. When he woke in the morning the sheets were twisted and pulled, a testimonial to his anguish. Daily he picked up the phone and dialed her number, hanging up before she answered.
To pass the lonely evenings he started looking at two bedroom apartments. He told himself that if Brittany still wanted him when he contacted her, he would surprise her with a dungeon. He found an apartment that was immediately available with a beamed ceiling and paid first and last month&#8217;s rent along with a cleaning deposit. He bought a wooden horse and a leather padded cross along with twenty feet of chain. He wondered what he would do if Brittany didn&#8217;t want to come back. He didn&#8217;t want to think about that possibility.
The place was move-in ready so Dave kept himself busy transferring all of his possessions to the new apartment. The lease on his current apartment wouldn&#8217;t be up for three more months. He&#8217;d have to pay for two places. As the dungeon took shape he decided the money would be well spent. While arranging the furniture and stocking the kitchen Dave found himself wondering how Brittany was handling their separation.
Alone in her apartment Brittany told herself Dave was right to demand this time for contemplation. But her heart ached for his kiss and her body longed to feel his whip, have his cock penetrate deep within her while he pinched her nipples. Hanging onto a slender rope of hope he would come for her after only a couple days instead of the designated week she removed her underwear every afternoon, but Dave didn&#8217;t came to pick her up. She talked to Yvonne on the phone for hours each evening, unable to pull together the reasons for Dave&#8217;s behavior.
When Brittany finally fell asleep at night she had the same dream. Dave was dressed in a three-piece black suit, white shirt, red tie imprinted with whips, polished black leather boots, and a leather attach� case filled with her toys. She was nude except for her silver collar, a leash that hung between her breasts and blue spike heels. Dave took her with him everywhere, carrying his attach� case in one hand, her leash in the other. When he was at work she would kneel beside his desk ready to freshen his coffee, sharpen his pencil, empty his trash basket. She felt happy when she overheard his colleagues refer to them as the Professor and his slave. Instead of taking a coffee break Dave tapped her on her shoulder and she would immediately get on her hands and knees for him to satisfy himself. She never know when he would point his index finger to the ground, so she stayed ready to respond instantly to his command. When she rode beside him in the car he tied her elbows behind her back so her breasts stood out for all the passing cars to see. He put clothespins on her nipples and pussy, then whipping her to a climax. When she woke in the morning she felt for Dave in the bed beside her, but all she found was emptiness.
Brittany recalled the night she had met Dave. His strong, self confident manner drew her to him immediately. When he guided her around the dance floor she felt alive. In his arms she was a flower opening one pedal at a time to reveal a variety of colors. His whips and ropes had made her feel more like a woman than ever before in her life. Now he was gone and she didn&#8217;t know why.
She trudged through each day. On Friday she took her time to arrange, then rearrange, the papers on her desk. She checked her Monday appointments. Thought about taking work home but decided not to. She removed her underwear in the restroom and, head down, slowly walked out to the street. From halfway across the parking lot she heard a throaty voice call her name. She looked up to see Dave standing against the hood of his Z-3 dangling her leash from his hand. Her eyes filled with tears as she ran to him with outstretched arms. She felt his arms around her waist, the power of his pectoral muscles under her cheek. She could hear his heartbeat mixed with her own; she smelled the warm musky scent of his skin. She felt relief flow through her entire body.
He bent down to nuzzle an ear and kiss her neck. �I want you, slave.�
She looked into his eyes, �I want you too, Master.�
He slowly disengaged himself, slid her slave ring on her finger, placed her silver collar around her neck and attached his leash. �Let&#8217;s go home,� he said.
In the car, Dave reached his hand up her skirt, felt her warm moist pussy tremble to his touch. He reached inside her blouse and pinched her hard nipples. Her soft gasps told him she wanted him as much as he wanted her.
Dave didn&#8217;t take the route home she expected. �Where are we going?� she asked.
�Home.�
Dave pulled into the underground parking space of a building Brittany didn&#8217;t recognize. He got out of the car and walked around to open Brittany&#8217;s door. He guided her up two flights of carpeted stairs to apartment 201. His key unlocked the door. As soon as they walked into the apartment Dave closed the door and pointed his index finger to the ground. Brittany dropped to her knees, gently removed his cock from his pants and took his long hard organ in her mouth. She flicked her tongue lightly and she felt him shiver. He put his hands on her head, guiding her head up and down his pulsating member.
�Oh slave, I need you so badly,� he cried out but held himself in check. Gently he raised her mouth off his outstretched organ and lifted her up to him. He kissed her tenderly, holding her tight like a rare ruby he never wanted to lose.
When he had assured himself she was securely in his possession, he stripped her and took her by her leash to a wooden cross in the newly established dungeon. She recognized the furniture. The picture of the suspended woman. Still she didn&#8217;t know where they were. He bound her wrists and ankles in leather cuffs clipped to the cross. He stood back to look at her. He could not speak. He could only marvel at his incredible luck in owning this delightful creature.
�Where are we?�
�In our new home.�
�Oh,� was all Brittany could think to say.
After a long while he took a needle and two silver rings from a wooden box on the floor next to the cross. With his tongue he went from one sensitive nipple to the other and in between. Then his tongue found her navel, circled it, and reached her soft mound. He spread her folds apart and held her right pussy lip between his fingers. He heard her cry out in anguish as his needle pierced her left pussy lip and his fingers inserted a silver ring. He cupped both breasts in his hands and kissed her tears tasting her salt. Gently he held her right pussy lip between his fingers, pierced it and inserted a matching silver ring.
Beads of sweat dripped from his forehead, his heart pounded and his cock throbbed. He felt her moistness and pushed into her, pulled out and pushed in again. He kissed her face, streaked with tears, then her mouth. �There&#8217;s no turning back now,� he said.
Their eyes were locked in silent understanding.
