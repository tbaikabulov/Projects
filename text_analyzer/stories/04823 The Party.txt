Synopsis: Julie\'s Master invites guests to a party where she will be the entertainment






Julie knelt by the front door.&nbsp; She maintained herself in the position that she knew he wanted; hands behind her back, knees wide apart, back straight, shoulders back head tilted down.&nbsp; She had been waiting in this position for half an hour, she did not know how much longer it would be.&nbsp; Her Master was elsewhere in the house getting ready for the party.&nbsp; Her knees were sore and she had a small itch on her cheek that she desperately wanted to scratch - but she kept still.



Around her neck a stainless steel collar glittered - she had spent 10 minutes making sure that not even one tiny smudge marred its mirror like finish.&nbsp; Attached to each of her nipples and each of her labia were tiny silver clamps and from each clamp hung a delicate three inch chain that supported a tiny bell.&nbsp; Any movement bought a delicate ring from the bells.&nbsp; The collar and clamps constituted all her clothing; even her pubic hair was closely trimmed to a small arrow pointing down.



The position of her head allowed her to view her body and how it was presented.&nbsp; She could see the delicate lips of her sex were open, a deeper shade of pink than usual, and slightly swollen.&nbsp; She knew that anyone who saw her would be able to see her excitement.&nbsp; She breathed in and smelled her own excitement; there would be no hiding how she was feeling.



She liked the fact that she was naked and waiting for her Master; it was so radically different from how she was sure most people would imagine her.&nbsp; His control over her never ceased to excite her, and she wanted it to continue, she wanted to be tested; to see how far it could go.&nbsp; 



She often fantasised about how far things might go.&nbsp; In some of her imaginings he would tie her tightly in front of a crowd of people then torture her for their enjoyment, taking no regard to her pleasure.&nbsp; He would ask them what they wanted to see and then do it to her for their amusement.&nbsp; Depending on her mood the imagined tortures varied from her being whipped until unconsciousness to needles pushed through her labia, nipples and countless other places.&nbsp; The consistent theme though was that she had no choice and more often than not did not want what was to be done, but it happened anyway, because he controlled her.



In other imaginings he would have her crawl naked behind him through public streets while people watched and pointed at her - calling her names that she knew she deserved.&nbsp; He would occasionally stop and talk to people, they would ask him about her, and he would have her kneel up and tell the people that she was his willing slave and that she choose and wanted to crawl behind him.&nbsp; If they still did not believe he would indicate to them that they should inspect her sex to see if she was enjoying it.&nbsp; Needless to say her sex was always drenched in the juices of her excitement.&nbsp; Sometimes then she imagined that he offered her to them for their use - the fantasy rarely got further than this before she would cum hard, her fingers pressed deeply into her sex and her back arched in pleasure.



Although Julie was still the bells were making a constant delicate sound.&nbsp; She knew that she should try to silence them, but it was her jagged breathing and the heavy beating of her heart that caused the vibration within her that set the bells ringing.&nbsp; Hard as she tried she could not slow her heart rate or quiet her breathing, in fact the harder she tried the faster her heart raced and the more uneven her breathing became.



It was the thoughts spinning inside her mind that caused her heart to beat so fast and her breathing to be so jagged.&nbsp; Soon people would come through the door and she would greet them.&nbsp; She would welcome them to her Master's house, take their coats, and bring them a glass of wine.&nbsp; She knew that she was not to obstruct their access to her body in any way.&nbsp; They could touch her, pinch her, spank her, do virtually anything they wanted with and to her, and she would not stop them.&nbsp; If they even looked like they wanted to use her in any way she would assist and make herself available.



He had told her that he was having a party several weeks previously.&nbsp; He stated it in simple terms; he was having a party for about 30 guests; she was to serve them drinks, serve them h�or doerves and ensure that they were happy.&nbsp; A simple enough sounding task, but she knew there would be more to it than serving drinks.&nbsp; She knew that he would want to provide 'entertainment' for his guests.&nbsp; The question in her mind was what would that entertainment be?



As she waited she imagined increasingly extreme possibilities of what might occur.&nbsp; With each new thought her breath became more ragged, her heart beat faster and her bells made more noise.&nbsp; She imagined hands touching her, harsh bondage, whips, objects forced into her, needles, clamps.&nbsp; With each new thought she could feel her sex tingling, she desperately wanted to touch herself.&nbsp; It took all her will power to restrain herself, but the harder she fought to drive the images from her mind - the greater power they took over her.&nbsp; Looking down she watched a tiny drop of her own juice slide from between her pussy lips, it was suspended for a second between her legs, before stretching to the cream carpet below.&nbsp; She closed her eyes as a shiver of absolute lust ran through her.



After some time, exactly how long she had no idea, she opened her eyes to see her Master standing before her.



"If you leave a stain on my carpet you will be well punished."&nbsp; The amusement in his voice belied his hard words.&nbsp; 



"Shall I tell my guests that you have been so excited by their imminent arrival that you have been leaking onto the floor? I am sure they would be very pleased to know."&nbsp; For a moment he laughed to himself before walking away.&nbsp; Her face blushed a hot red as she wondered for how long her eyes had been shut, and for how long he had stood before her.&nbsp; Her embarrassment did nothing to aid her in controlling her excitement, instead it drove it higher.&nbsp; The image of her Master informing his guests of her excitment while she stood naked in front of them caused yet another wave of lust to wash over her. 



Several minutes later the sound of the door bell woke her from her thoughts.&nbsp; She raised herself up from her knees, stood on slightly unsteady legs, stepped to the door and, hesitating for a few seconds to gather her courage, opened it.



Standing under the soft light of the doorway was a couple - both elegantly dressed; she in towering heels and an evening dress underneath a long coat, and he in a dinner suit.&nbsp; For a split second a thought flashed through her mind - what might these people wish to do with her? - before she gathered herself together and with a smile invited them into the house.&nbsp; She took the ladies coat and hung it carefully in the hall closet before showing them through to the lounge.&nbsp; Her Master swept into the room and drew the attention of the couple, while Julie went to the kitchen to get them a glass of champagne.&nbsp; Once they were given the glasses she paused for a second to see if they wanted anything else then moved back to her position kneeling by the door.



Over the next twenty minutes the guests trickled in.&nbsp; Julie hung their coats and got them drinks, all the time trying to hide her embarrassment that they were all beautifully dressed and she was naked.&nbsp; Some of them obviously noticed her excitement and smiled while gently tapping her bottom.&nbsp; She could feel the wetness between her legs as she could not help wondering with each new set of people what they might want of her.&nbsp; The thought that she was at a different level to them was clear in her mind; she was the naked slave; they the elegant elite.



Julie served them all in a state of daze.&nbsp; She could not rid her mind of the images of what they might do to her, and the sure knowledge that they all knew that she was sexually excited to be naked in front of them did not allow her mind to focus.&nbsp; Only after about an hour did she begin to calm down.&nbsp; They all had drinks, they had all eaten small amounts of food.&nbsp; She took her place standing just behind and to one side of her Master.&nbsp; She stood as she knew he would want; legs apart, hands behind her back, head tilted down.



As he spoke with various people he let his hand drift back to rest between Julie's legs.&nbsp; His fingers played between her thighs, drifting across her clitoris and gently sliding along the moist length of her sex.&nbsp; He did it unthinkingly; it in no way drew his attention away from his guests.



For Julie it was a different matter.&nbsp; She was already highly excited and his touch bought her higher, to the edge of orgasm.&nbsp; She tried to hold herself back, tried to close her eyes and concentrate on something else, but nothing worked.&nbsp; She could feel a sheen of sweat developing on her skin as she fought the desire to cum.&nbsp; Her bells rang, her body shook slightly.&nbsp; She could not remain silent and small noises crept out from between her lips.&nbsp; Her mind drifted and she could focus on nothing but the sensation between her legs.&nbsp; Her breathing became ragged and then she could hold back no longer.



Her orgasm struck her like a blow, coursing through her body, bringing a cry of pleasure to her lips.&nbsp; Her body shook as muscles that had long been held tense rippled with pleasure.&nbsp; Her legs could not hold her and she sunk to her knees.&nbsp; Without her willing it her hands moved to her sex, sliding her fingers into her wet sex, making the orgasm last longer.&nbsp; Wave after wave of pleasure poured through her.



--



Slowly she returned from her pleasure and realised were she was.&nbsp; The conversation had stopped and all the guests stood and silently watched her.&nbsp; Her Master had turned and stood squarely in front of her.&nbsp; The reality of what had happened struck her.&nbsp; She had reached orgasm in front of all these elegant people.&nbsp; She wanted to curl up and disappear.&nbsp; 



His voice broke the silence.&nbsp; He spoke slowly, "Julie.&nbsp; I do not believe that I gave you permission for that.&nbsp; You have interrupted my conversation.&nbsp; And whilst I am sure that everyone here appreciates the delights that an orgasm can bring, I doubt that they would consider it appropriate to do so in the middle of a party."



Julie lowered her head to his shoes and mumbled; "I'm sorry Master, I could not help it."



"I did not hear you Julie, louder so that my guests and I might hear fully why this has happened."



Julie swallowed her nerves and spoke out loud, but still with her head hiding at his feet.&nbsp; Her voice shook, "I am sorry Master.&nbsp; I could not help myself.&nbsp; Your hand on me, after the last hour.&nbsp; It was too much.&nbsp; I'm sorry."



There was a moment�s pause before her Master spoke again.&nbsp; "I see.&nbsp; First you will apologise not just to me but to everyone here.&nbsp; You will do so by crawling to each person, placing a kiss on their shoe and requesting their forgiveness.&nbsp; Once you have done this you will place yourself in the corner of the room; on your knees with our shoulders to the floor, facing into the corner.&nbsp; I will then take some time to consider what the most appropriate response might be for your actions.&nbsp; Do you understand?"



In a small voice Julie said "Yes Master.&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand."&nbsp; Keeping her head down she crawled around the room, stopping at each person and placing her lips on their shoes for a second, before softly asking for their forgiveness.&nbsp; Once each guest had given their forgiveness - some seriously, some with laughter in their voice - she moved on.&nbsp; Finally when all had been asked, she moved to the corner and placed herself as he wanted her.



The position elevated her buttocks and presented her sex to the room.&nbsp; Julie could feel the cool air on her now swollen and open sex, and was intimately aware that this was the part of her that everyone in the room would see.&nbsp; She felt as if she was just her sex, as if little else of her existed, her mind was focused on it, all her sensations were focused on it.&nbsp; She could not stop herself from clenching the muscles of her groin, knowing that the people would see it.&nbsp; Her body ached to be touched as she was overcome with a desire for someone, anyone, to slide their hand between her pussy lips.&nbsp; She felt the desire like a physical pain.



Julie feared but wanted the punishment that she knew was coming.&nbsp; She did not care if it was painful or humiliating, just so long as she would be used.



Some amount of time passed.&nbsp; Julie waited, desperately wanting to know what was going to happen, desperately wanting it whatever it was.&nbsp; Her desire was so strong it bought tears of frustration to her eyes.



-----



The touch of her Masters hand on her head startled Julie from her thoughts.&nbsp; Without speaking he grasped her hair and pulled her up to a crawling position.&nbsp; Holding her hair in his fist he walked back to the centre of the room - Julie crawled rapidly at his side.&nbsp; His hold on her hair was firm and unyielding, however he moved slowly enough to ensure that should could follow him with little difficulty and little pain.



He pulled her roughly to her feet.&nbsp; Within a few seconds her wrists were tightly bound together in front of her, her hands palm to palm.&nbsp; The rope was quickly passed through an eye bolt in the ceiling and pulled tight, lifting her hands high above her head.&nbsp; He slowly increased the tension in the rope until she was stretched tight, just able to stand on her toes with her hands taking some of her weight, then he tied the rope off.&nbsp; He placed a large ball gag around her head, forcing her mouth open wide.&nbsp; Finally he placed a spreader bar between her knees.&nbsp; The result was that she hung mostly suspended in the middle of the room, her toes only giving the slightest of support.



Reaching forward her Master grabbed the silver clamps on her nipples and with one movement yanked them from her.&nbsp; Another movement and the clamps from her labia where pulled free.&nbsp; The sting in her nipples and labia from the returning blood sent a rush of lust through her.



Julie struggled to control the discomfort of her position, her chest heaving with the effort and her stomach muscles quivering.&nbsp; A low but steady moan came from behind the gag.&nbsp; She looked briefly around at the people surrounding her, all staring at her and smiling at her obviously painful position, but she could not hold their eyes.&nbsp; Part of her wanted them to see her punished, for them to enjoy her pain; and she wanted to give them everything they wanted, to hide nothing, to be theirs as well as her Master's, to be the lowest in the room, the toy, to be used however they wished, controlled.&nbsp; She wanted to tell them to use her, hurt her, however they wished.&nbsp; Another part of her was ashamed though, how could she allow herself to be displayed and used like this. She closed her eyes and let the feelings of pain from her position, and the desire from her thoughts run through her.



The guests stood around her and enjoyed the sight she made.&nbsp; The tension in her body making it quiver in the most beautiful ways; her breasts shook gently with her breathing, her stomach and leg muscles quivering; even the muscles of her sex - so beautifully displayed by the spreaderbar - were in constant motion.&nbsp; They could see her excitement and mixed reactions displayed so clearly in every movement.



For a while he left her to hang there.&nbsp; The guests used the opportunity to touch her and to feel the movement in her body that they so enjoyed watching.&nbsp; Someone gently slapped her pubic mound, making her body swing slightly in its suspension.&nbsp; Another reached forward to pinch one of the erect nipples that quivered before them.&nbsp; Another let their finger slide between the lips of her sex - smiling to the others at both the immediate response from her as she moved to push harder against it, and at the large amount of her moisture that remained on their finger once it was removed.&nbsp; Everyone enjoyed the sensation of placing their hands on her stomach and feeling the muscles ripple beneath them.



Julie felt the hands exploring her.&nbsp; She wished they would do more.&nbsp; Her nipples ached to be touched and squeezed, pinched.&nbsp; Her sex throbbed with desire; she hoped that someone would slap her there, play with her labia, pull them out for all to see.&nbsp; Every inch of her skin desired the harsh slap of a hand.



Seeing that his guests were enjoying her body so much Julie's Master allowed a few more minutes of this.&nbsp; He could tell that she was moving to higher levels of excitement - loving every moment of this so called punishment, but he was also aware that there was only so long that she could hang by her hands before the loss of circulation would become problematic.



Finally he stepped in and quietly motioned for the guests to step back from Julie, leaving her panting with excitement, her body covered in a thin sheen of sweat.&nbsp; She opened her eyes briefly to see him standing before her with a single tailed whip in his hand.&nbsp; Full of fear and excitement she closed her eyes again, and to show him her submission pushed her spread her legs and her chest out as much as her position allowed.



The first snap of the whip landed on her pubic mound.&nbsp; Her cry of pain was muffled by the gag but far from silenced by it.&nbsp; Julie's Master and his guests watched with pleasure as Julie struggled to contain the pain, and a small red mark of the whip blossomed on her skin.&nbsp; He struck again this time on the bottom of her breast, paused then struck the other.&nbsp; 



Slowly he increased the pace and strength of his strokes.&nbsp; Her cries merged into one as her body shook in its bondage.&nbsp; Her skin became a canvas of red slashes as the whip bit into her skin - her breasts, her stomach, her pubic mound, her ass.&nbsp; 



The pain seared from her skin into her brain, but somehow for Julie the pain was pleasure.&nbsp; Each sting quickly followed by a surge of pleasure.&nbsp; Rather than try and avoid the whip she sought its sting with her body, pushing forward her breasts so that the whip might land on her nipples and fill her with a rush of pleasure.&nbsp; She knew in her mind that the more each stroke hurt her, the more pleasure the guests and her Master would take from it.&nbsp; She wanted to give them that pleasure so she hoped that he would strike her even harder, land it on her most tender parts.&nbsp; When the tip of the whip cracked over her nipple a surge of agonising pain raced through her and a cry of pain was wrenched from her lips it was accompanied by a burst of pride within her knowing that this must have given them pleasure.&nbsp; He seemed to sense her feelings and for a moment concentrated the whip over her tender nipples; each stroke bought her agony and intense pleasure.



Slowly he changed his strokes the whip began to concentrate down around her sex.&nbsp; The sting of the leather struck the soft skin of her lips, bringing a shock of pain which sent her body rigid before the rush of pleasure surged through her.&nbsp; Her mind became a haze of pain and pleasure as the whip struck again and again.



Then the whip cracked across her clitoris.&nbsp; Her body went rigid, her scream stifled by the shock in her body.&nbsp; He struck it again before she had a chance to recover.&nbsp; Then again.&nbsp; Again.



She could feel both the pain and the pleasure.&nbsp; Feel her body lifting, the tension increasing.&nbsp; Her eyes opened wide but she saw nothing.&nbsp; Her mind focused only on her sex, the searing heat running from it up her spine and into her mind.



He struck again.&nbsp; Julie exploded in orgasm.&nbsp; Her body shaking as the rush of pleasure took her.&nbsp; Her mind lost everything except the pleasure coursing through her, starting at her sex and running up her back to flood her head.&nbsp; Wave after wave of pleasure rolled through her.



--



Eventually she returned to herself; opened her eyes to see her Master standing quietly in front of her.&nbsp; She wanted to thank him, to fall at his feet and show him her gratitude for the gift he had given her with the punishment.



He let her hang for a moment then released the rope and let her fall to her knees.&nbsp; He stood for a long time smiling down at her, pleased with how beautiful she was, as she knelt on the floor holding his ankles, her face pressed to the soft leather of his boot.



She had no concept of how long she knelt.&nbsp; Her body was exhausted and she was happy just to kneel holding him, wanting to show him how fully she was his.



Eventually he placed his hand on her head and she raised herself up.&nbsp; He removed the gag, the rope and the spreader bar.&nbsp; He indicated the empty glasses of his guests whom she had completely forgotten.&nbsp; Slowly she climbed to her feet, then made her way unsteadily to the kitchen returning with wine to fill the glasses.



As she recovered herself she found she had lost all the tension of before.&nbsp; She no longer considered the fact that they were dressed and she naked.&nbsp; She stood proudly as they admired the marks on her skin.&nbsp; She knew that they had taken pleasure from each stroke, from each cry of pain.&nbsp; 



The rest of the evening disappeared in a happy blur of serving her Master, and having hands stroke her skin to feel the welts.
