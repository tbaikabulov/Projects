Synopsis: Jill had absolutely no clue what working as a sales agent for medical tools might entail - needless to say, she was rather hesitant to join the fun. Not that she was left much choice, her devious female boss had seen to that - and now that she's in, pain and humiliation seem to wait around every corner.

A New Guinea Pig

&nbsp;

Chapter 1
- Trapped

&nbsp;

Jill Summers still felt a
little dizzy after having been on the regular girls' night out with her
co-workers. Though it had been a rather long and funny evening, she did only
drink her usual two Marghueritas, and she had shrugged off the hangover feeling
as symptoms of &quot;getting older&quot;. Not that she had any reason to use
the word &quot;old&quot;.

&nbsp;

With her 30 years she was in
good shape, alternating between jogging and biking as a workout every day. She
had her blonde hair cut above her shoulders, with tiny streaks of red and
brown. Some of her friends used to tell her it made her look boyish, but it was
quite practical this way, and it made her definitely look two or three years
younger.

&nbsp;

And although Jill was
overall quite pleased with her own body, and being five feet six wasn't a model
height, she was slim and muscular. The only thing she envied other women for
were breast sizes, hers being only just big enough for B cups. Not that it
mattered to her very much, but she had often noticed the appreciating stares
the guys sent to bigger sized females.

&nbsp;

Gulping down the remainders
of the fifth cup of coffee, Jill rose from the breakfast table to get ready for
her appointment. Trying to shake the last of the dizzyness from her head she
fetched the car keys and her purse. A look to the clock made her jump. She had
only fifteen minutes left, which ment that she had to really hurry to get to
the doctor in time. Cursing whoever had scheduled the yearly medical for her at
nine o'clock on a Saturday, ironically also the Saturday that started her first
week of holidays since she had started work at the company, she left the flat
and entered her car.

&nbsp;

**

&nbsp;

Luckily she got to the
doctor's office in time. The company, who required every employee to take an
examination every year, took it quite seriously if one tried to circumvent it.
The firm Jill worked for, TouchMe Medical Appliances, manufactured all sort of
medical equipment, and had therefore - understandingly - rather rigid rules on
hygieny. And though Jill, as a telephone sales agent, would probably never have
a reason to set foot into the production halls, the rules also applied to her,
as her boss, Mrs. Parker, had pointed out to her in the job interview nine
months ago.

&nbsp;

Approaching the reception
she met a friendly looking young girl of about eightteen, with shoulder length
dark brown hair and big green eyes, which immediately focused on Jill at her
entry.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hi, you must be Ms.
Summers. The doctor is already waiting for you in room D, that's all the way
down if you turn left.&quot;

&nbsp;

Jill hastily greeted back
and went to meet the doctor.

&nbsp;

The room she entered look
rather impressive. Everything, furniture and equipment, appeared to be quite
new. Nothing like the examination rooms she was used to from her private visits
to doctors. The interior was shiny, modern looking, with a lot of chromed steel
and blueish smoked glass. She instantly recognized a number of expensive
appliances from her company.

&nbsp;

&quot;Good morning, Dr.
Weaver.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Ah, good morning, Ms.
Summers. I'm glad you could make it today. We are closed over the next week, so
we had a little trouble fitting in all the appointments on normal workdays. So
I'll try to do my best and be as quick as possible. It should only be some
routine checks, after all.&quot;

&nbsp;

The physician, a woman of
about fourtyfive, gave her an assuring nod and gestured her to sit on the
examination table. Jill noticed the slender figure the doctor had, and if it
weren't for the few streaks of silver in the red hair that fell in slight waves
to the middle of the doctor's back in a loose pony tail, she could very well
have passed as ten years younger. First thing Jill had to sign an agreement
form that the results of the examination were to be disclosed to the company.
After that the doctor took a few blood samples and carried them into another
room before she announced the boring part of the examination to begin. The went
through a number of paper sheets, Dr. Weaver questioning her the usual thing
like having had any child's diseases, broken bones and the like.

&nbsp;

They were just finished with
the questionaire when the girl from the reception stuck her head in

and asked to speak the
doctor for a minute. Dr. Weaver told Jill to strip down naked in the meantime
and to lie down on the examination chair for the practical part.

&nbsp;

Jill stood for a few
seconds. This was her first examination for the company, so she didn't know
what needed to be checked. Yet she wasn't used to stripping down in front of
strangers, and she had even had a few talk-only visits with her gyneocologist
before she felt sure enough to undress in front of him. She calmed herself with
the fact that Dr. Weaver was a woman, and reminding herself that she had
showered together with other girls at school after sports she quickly slipped
out of her clothing and arranged them on a nearby chair, before hopping onto
the examination table.

&nbsp;

As she lay on the table,
Jill got more conscious of her nakedness. The air was cool to the bare skin,
and after a minute she felt her nipples grow hard. With no clock to look at it
seemed like an hour until the doctor came back, wearing a stern expression.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ms. Summers, we have a
little problem that we need to talk about.&quot;

&nbsp;

Jill was startled. She
didn't have a clue what the woman referred to, but judging from the sharp words
it must be something serious. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Did you really tell me
everything about your, ehm, history?&quot;

&nbsp;

The doctor's dark brown eyes
pierced hers now. Trying to make her mind up, Jill suddenly became aware of how
awkward the whole situation was, her naked being interrogated by the physician.
She felt her face blushing furiously.

&nbsp;

&quot;Sorry, Dr. Weaver, I
don't know what you're referring to.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Then let me try to
help you.&quot; The doctor moved close to the table, which somehow made this
situation really intimidating. &quot;Didn't you, mabe accidentially, slip in
the wrong answer to the questions about drug experiences?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Drugs?!&quot; Jill
almost shouted. &quot;But I've never taken drugs in my life!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;The tests we made tell
something different.&quot;

&nbsp;

Jill had to put her hands
onto the table to stop them from trembling. How could this be? She knew that
drug abuse would be a major offence against the working contract, so she would
be immediately fired if word got to her boss about that.

&nbsp;

&quot;But I haven't taken
any drugs, I swear! Someone must have put them into my drinks yesterday!&quot;

&nbsp;

The doctor only sent her a
cold smile. &quot;I see, but you don't think I've heard that explanation
before, do you?&quot;

&nbsp;

Jill was desperate. How
could she convince the doctor that this was a mistake, that she had never
actively taken drugs? She needed to, as she was dependent on her job. What her
employer didn't know was that she had to pay a monthly fine due to a car
accident she had had six month ago, with a little too much to drink. Loosing
her job meant no money to pay the fine, which in turn meant that she had to go
to jail.

&nbsp;

&quot;But maybe there was an
error with the test?&quot; She asked expectingly.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm sorry, no error.
We did it twice, with two different samples and two different machines, and we
got exactly the same results.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But I can't loose my
job! Please, you can't report this!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I can't?&quot; The
doctor was angry now, running her hand through her mane of red hair. &quot;I'd
rather say I can't not report this. Can you imagine what happened if
word got out I'm betraying my customers?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Please, Dr. Weaver,
please don't report it.&quot; Jill was sobbing now. &quot;Please. I'll do
whatever you want, but please don't report me.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm sorry, but ï¿½ wait,
did you say whatever I want?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, anything!
Anything, if you don't tell my boss!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Does that anything
really mean 'anything', Ms. Summers?&quot; A sly smile was now playing around
the doctor's mouth, but Jill was too eager to jump on this chance to notice it
through her tear filled eyes.

&nbsp;

&quot;Anything you want.
Really anything!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Then I might have an
idea.&quot; Jill let out a sigh of reliev, but was instantly brought back be
the doctor who had gripped her right arm firmly. &quot;But before you relax,
what I'll request of you won't be easy, nor will it be painless. It's your
choice.&quot;

&nbsp;

With this words, Dr. Weavers
other hand had travelled to Jill's left breast, first squeezing it hard, then
forcefully pinching her nipple. Jill gasped at the sudden pain, but it brought
her some ideas of what Dr. Weaver might have in mind with her. But having to
sexually please an older woman would most propably be worlds better than
spending two years in prison. And if rumurs were true, she might get raped in
prison just as well.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'll do it, whatever
you ask of me.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Like I said, it's your
choice, but I'm happy you agreed. But to get to see if you are serious, I'll
have to do a few tests. Turn over and get on your hands and knees.&quot;

&nbsp;

Jill immediately complied,
and while she heared the doctor rummaging through some drawers she didn't dare
to turn her head. A weired sensation ran through her body that made her head
spin. She still couldn't believe what was happening here. An hour ago she had
just been a normal woman, with a job, a nice rented flat, and the only thing
troubling her if she would get a pay rise in the next time. Now she was to be
the lesbian plaything for this doctor, fifteen years older than her. Fresh
tears trickled down her face.

&nbsp;

**

&nbsp;

Something cold and wet
pressed between her ass cheeks, and Jill jumped.

&nbsp;

&quot;Now, now.&quot; Came
the voice of the doctor. &quot;Nothing to worry about. We'll just see that you are
nice and clean.&quot;

&nbsp;

Jill recognized the thing as
a gloved finger with some kind of lubricant on it. The finger pressed harder
against her rear opening, and she felt like she was about to shit. She had
never been penetrated there, and it embarrassed her completely. Trying to focus
on what was at stake, she managed not to pull away while the finger thrust into
her rear and probed around.

&nbsp;

A little later the finger
was withdrawn and replaced by something bigger, and she instinctively flinched
as it probed her anus.

&nbsp;

&quot;Relax, or it will
hurt.&quot;

&nbsp;

Jill tried her best, and
soon something big slid into her anus, stretching her painfully. She let out a
loud gasp, but in a blink the pain receded as the thing shoved into her seemed
to become thinner again. What remained was a feeling of fullness.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm about to give you
an enema now. I've inserted a butt plug with a valve so you don't have to worry
about keeping it in.&quot; The doctor informed her.

&nbsp;

She felt a bit of tugging on
the butt plug and suddenly a warmth spread from her inside. As the enema rushed
into her, Jill felt her legs tremble slightly in reaction to the unknown
sensation. The doctor told her not to move until ordered otherwise and left the
room.

&nbsp;

Jill didn't hear the door
click closed and assumed that it had been left open. Trying not to think of the
receptionist walking by she closed her eyes and focused on her own breathing.

&nbsp;

The first two minutes went
by without anything extraordinary apart from the still spreading warmth, but
after that Jill felt a growing urge to empty herself. The warmth was more and
more replaced by a steadily rising preasure from the inside. After about five
minutes, which felt like an eternity to the young woman, her bowels started to
growl, and she experienced the beginnings of light cramps. Ten minutes into the
ordeal, the cramps got really heavy. A hot point seemed to run through her
stomach in waves, and she begged in her mind for the doctor to come back and
relieve her.

&nbsp;

But it took another ten
minutes until she heard footsteps approaching, and by this time she lying on
her side in a fetal position, sobbing uncontrollably.

&nbsp;

&quot;Now, don't cry, Ms.
Summers, you can get rid of it shortly.&quot; Hearing the voice and feeling a
stroking hand on her thigh she was startled back into reality. Standing next to
her was not the doctor, but the young assistant. Jill had never before in her
life felt so humiliated. She wanted to scream loudly, but between the cramps
she only managed a soft whimper.

&nbsp;

&quot;You have just a few
thing to do, then we are finished.&quot; The girl assured her with soothing
voice. &quot;First of all, you have to sit up on your knees on the table.&quot;

&nbsp;

Jill struggled to get up,
only thinking of the moment she could get rid of the pain. The girl had to help
her, as her legs ware shaking badly now. Once sitting upright on her legs she
was told to spread her knees apart as far as she could. After that, she was
told to rub and pinch her nipples. Complying, she noticed that, in spite of the
pain she was in, they instantly got erect and were very sensitive now, even
sensitiver as usual. And caressing and pinching them helped her take her mind
from the pain in her stomach.

&nbsp;

Next she was ordered to move
one hand to her pussy, first to rub it, then to stick a finger inside and
finger fuck herself. She again did as ordered, and with her eyes again closed
she had only the sensations from that or the pain to focus on, giving her
hardly a choice. Fingering herself aroused her, and though it added to her
humiliation, she couldn't stop it. Soon she was humping her finger desperately,
only trying to intensify this ecstatic feeling that was so much better than the
fire in her bowels.

&nbsp;

With a gurgling breath she
came hard, her juices running freely over her hand. Her body was covered in
sweat from head to toe, and her hand firmly pressed onto her crotch. But as the
last waves of the orgasm receded, the pain was back, and stronger than before.
She had to do her best to keep from toppling over.

&nbsp;

The girl told Jill to get
back on her hands and knees, and soon after some nestling with the butt plug
Jill felt the pressure slowly lessen. She was still shaking every now and then
when her body attempted to get rid of the foreign liquid all at once. After
another ten minutes the assistant declared that she were sufficiently emptied
now and removed the butt plug with a quick pull that Jill didn't mind anymore
now.

&nbsp;

&quot;My, that looks
funny,&quot; the assistant told her with a broad grin, &quot;you'll have to
wait a minute till your plucker will close again. You're gaping open so wide, I
could drop a table tennis ball inside you without hassle.&quot; Fresh tears of
shame began to cover Jill's face.

&nbsp;

A bit later she was helped
from the examination table. She didn't really recall dressing and driving home,
nor could she really bear to think about what had conspired at the doctor's.
Her mind was in a strange state of automatic drive, and she didn't even recall
taking the small package that was now lying next to her on the passenger seat.

When Jill arrived back at her flat, she stopped the engine of her car and slumped back in her seat, her hands still firmly wrapped around the steering wheel and trembling furiously. She closed her eyes, trying to assure herself that this had all been just a dream, but the stinging in her butt and the growling from her stomach told her that the last hours had been quite real.
Shaking off the weird feelings she grabbed for her purse and for the first time really noticed the book-sized package. It was wrapped in black paper and rather lightweight, bearing a white sticker with ï¿½open at homeï¿½ written by hand. Jill took a deep breath before exiting her car on shaky legs and walking quickly to her flat. Thank god she had her own entrance on the ground level, as she became aware of how dishevelled she had to be looking right now - meeting nosy neighbours and having to explain that wasn't anything she fancied right now.
A shower, that was all she wanted now. She dropped her clothes on the floor along the way and more stumbled than stepped into the stall, turning on the water as hot as she could bear it. The reality of today's event started to settle in, and with a loud sob her knees gave way and her back slid down the wet tiles. The shame and humiliation rolled down over her in waves. How could she have enjoyed that? She asked herself, not understanding how her body could have betrayed her like this.
The situation had been so alien, so unreal. She should have felt only disgust at that time, but somehow her body had developed a mind on its own. Despite the bad treatment she had felt the arousal take over. And now that she was thinking about the whole thing, she found her sex once again betraying her, as a hot, pulling feeling shot through her pussy. Without really noticing it, her hand had travelled between her thighs and was softly rubbing her sex. She was startled for an instance, but shaking her head she sent all thought about what she was doing to hell and started to caress her breasts with the other hand. All that she wanted were a few minutes of not thinking, and pleasuring herself was a means to that.
With her eyes closed and the spray of hot water massaging her skin she could pretend that she was somewhere else. She focused on the feeling of arousal in her pussy and breasts, not wanting to imagine anyone's face.
Jill was not a prude. The relationship between her and Tom, her ex-boyfriend, had been quite sexual. Maybe a bit too sexual, she had reasoned after the breakup, when Tom had - suddenly and without talking to her about it beforehand - announced that he would be going to work in the States the other week. She had thrown quite a tantrum then, but been unable to sway his decision, and after he had left three months ago she had resigned herself with the conclusion that it obviously had only been a sex thing for him.
Still, when she was laying awake at night and fondling herself into sweet bliss in the lonely confines of her flat, it was mostly him that her imagination projected. She had trusted him, even enough to overcome the rigid limits embossed on her by her straight catholic upbringing. When they had first met, having sex in a public place like the nightly park would have appalled her. With Tom, she had felt enough trust to risk dares like that, and the reward had been a feeling of sexual fulfilment that she hadn't known existed before.
But now, as she was reaching her climax in the damp shower stall, breathing hard and frantically rubbing her clit, for few moments it wasn't Tom's hand that kneaded her breasts but Doctor Weaver's. And even as she realized that, waves of pleasure exploded from her swollen pussy and nipples and shot all through her body and mind. She didn't hear herself shout ï¿½no, noï¿½ repeatedly in a futile attempt to resist. Thousands of tiny needle pricks shot through her pumping pussy, making her gasp and cry out as another wave of orgasm hit her and washed all thoughts away. She held on to the feeling of joy and freedom that shot through her, until the last contractions in her sex subsided. Her arms and legs were trembling from the intensity of her climax, so she simply sat there for a few minutes, letting the water drown out all notions of coherent thought.
* * *
Jill emerged from the bathroom half an hour later in her white terry cloth bathrobe that had found its way into her suitcase years ago on vacation. Fetching a glass from the cupboard and a bottle of white wine from the fridge she made herself comfortable on the couch, switching the TV to some mindless talk show and dimming the light. Sipping from the wine, she tried to not look at the mysterious black package resting on the table. Whatever it contained, it wouldn't be good, she was sure of that much.
After she had emptied the glass of whine, she realized that she hadn't registered a word from the TV show. But by now the alcohol was doing its work and she began to feel a giddy detachedness from reality. With a resigned breath she reached for the parcel and opened the lid on the side. She had to shake it a bit until the contents came free, puzzling her as she watched the items in her hand. There was a clear plastic bag with some kind of tube attached, two black rubber rings roughly an inch wide and with a three inch diameter, and a letter.
Dreading the worst, she slowly unfolded the letter and began to read.
Dearest Jill,
I am glad you decided to go with our little agreement. I'll assure you it will provide us with loads of fun over the next time. To get us started, I expect you at my practice at precisely 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. When you get there, you are supposed to wear a dress and shoes, but no underwear or stockings.
If you haven't already figured out the meaning of this parcel's contents by yourself, here are the instructions pertaining to them:
The plastic bag is an enema bag. Before you come here, you are to administer yourself an enema with soap water, as hot as you can bear it, and hold it for fifteen minutes before expelling it. I am planning on doing a number of examinations where any failure in doing so will become obvious and will be considered a breach of our contract. You are aware of what that entails.
After the enema you are to shave your body completely clean and I won't tolerate a hair anywhere else than on your head.
Before leaving the house, you are to apply the rubber rings, one on each of your breasts, to make sure that they are sufficiently sensitive for the examination.
Dr. Weaver
Jill closed her eyes and bit down on her lip. This woman was plain sick. What had gotten into herself to agree to this? But she didn't have any other option. She was at this evil woman's mercy, and she seemed only to eager to take advantage of that. Maybe she could somehow find a way out later, but for now she would have to go with anything that woman demanded.
* * *
When the alarm went off at six in the morning, Jill felt rather relieved. She had tossed and turned the whole night and been hardly able to close her eyes, out of dread what the next day might entail. While she made herself a coffee,all she could do was not break into tears out of trepidation. So she grabbed Dr. Weaver's ï¿½presentsï¿½ from the living room table and made her way into the bath.
Filling up the enema bag took her quite some time. She didn't really have any experience with that, save yesterday's events, and therefore was unsure how hot the water could be. Finally, after filling up the sink for the third time and stirring in some soap, she settled on a temperature that felt only slightly hot on her skin.
She quickly slipped out of her bathrobe before she could question her own actions, and taking the enema bag and a small jar of skin cream, she got on all fours on the small carpet. She carefully coated the nozzle with a good measure of cream before reaching back between her legs and positioning it against her plucker. Guiding it inside took a few tries, but at last she managed to relax her sphincter sufficiently for the thumb sized nozzle to slip in. Though she could definitely feel the foreign object, she wasn't nearly as stretched as the day before. Jill realized that she he had to do something to force the soapy fluid into her body.
She squeezed the bag slightly and instantly a rush of heat shot into her behind, making her stomach spasm. She gave a yelp and let the enema bag go, letting her had hang down. The sight didn't ease her emotional turmoil, as she watched her tits hanging down and the rubber tube vanishing obscenely between her legs. She squeezed again, this time gentler, and gave a thankful sigh as the fluid flowed in this time with more bearable speed. It didn't take her long to develop a feeling of fullness again, and had to struggle to get everything into herself before the cramps became too intensive.
After endless five minutes the bag was empty and Jill had begun to sweat. From her naked position on the floor she watched the sweep hand on the clock above the door, focussing on the seconds ticking by instead of the hot contractions that shook her lower body. How could she have become like that in not even a day? She question herself time and time again.
The last two of the fifteen minutes seemed to take forever to go by. Unbidden images of herself on the examination table flashed through her mind. When the time was over she yanked the tube out of her plucker, an action she regretted instantly. As soon as the instrument was removed, her body set its mind to expelling the irritating fluid. She pressed her sphincter closed with all her might and crawled clumsily over to the toilet, heaving herself on the seat with shaking legs.
The fluid gushed out of her with obscene noise before her ass cheeks made contact with the seat. And in spite of the humiliation, together with the relief of getting rid of the painful pressure Jill felt a strange tingle in her pussy.
When the last cramp had subsided, Jill rinsed herself off in the shower and proceeded with the next task. She carefully shaved herself between her legs and, again a bit humiliating as she needed to squat over a mirror to see what she was doing, her ass cheeks. She usually had her bush trimmed down to a strip of about two inch, but being completely hairless down there made her feel double as nude and somehow girlish. Shaving her arms was also new to her, but she had to admit that the skin felt much smoother this way.
It took a good hour of rummaging through her closet until she found a dress that still fit her. She usually wore bluejeans when at home and skirt and blouse for work. The only dress that she could find and that went with the heat outside was a rather tight, cream coloured one with short sleeves, the hem ending way above the knees.
A look at the clock almost sent her into panic. Only twenty minutes left! She was almost in the dress when she remembered the rubber bands. Slipping back out, she ran to fetch the two rings and examined them quickly. There was only one way to apply them, and that was to slip them around the bases of her breasts.
Doing so to more force to stretch them sufficiently than she had initially thought, and when they tightened around her breasts she could feel the blood gathering there. But she had no time to loose, so she hastily donned the dress and a pair of equally cream coloured high heeled shoes.
By the time she started her car the two rubber bands encircling her tits already made themselves noticed with a tingling sensation, and, looking down, Jill could see her nipples stick out clearly through the fabric of the dress. The feeling got worse during the ride, and every small movement made the fabric rub against the soft skin, until she thought she could bear it no longer. The cool air from the air con blew all the way up between her legs, making her feel naked and exposed, and every time she passed another car or a pedestrian it was as if they were staring at her.
* * *
When she finally reached Dr. Weaver's, Jill had resigned herself to the feeling and was now constantly reminding herself to do everything the wicked woman would ask of her. No wicked sexual act could be that bad that going to jail would be a better option.
She rang the door bell with a trembling hand and waited. She hadn't dared to put on a watch, too scared that the Doctor might regard that as wearing more than the dress and shoes. The seconds ticked by and no movement could be heard or seen inside the office. Jill was just about to ring again, when the door opened and the red haired doctor appeared, clad in what seemed like a lab coat made from white rubber.
ï¿½I see, you made it in time.ï¿½ The doctor looked her up and down with an appraising look. ï¿½And it looks like you're able to follow orders too. But let's see what's inside the package.ï¿½
With that, the older women stepped closer to Jill, reaching out under the hem of Jill's dress with one hand and running it over her nude snatch. Jill had to muster all her courage to keep from jerking away. Panic rose in her, as she realized that she was standing out in the open, for every passer-by to see, with the doctor's hand groping lewdly between her legs.
ï¿½I love it when you blush like this,ï¿½ Dr. Weaver complimented her sarcastically, ï¿½and today will have you do that a lot, believe me. Take off your dress.ï¿½
Jill's eyes grew wide at the request. ï¿½But, Dr. Weaver, I can't &#8211; here &#8211; everyone could see,ï¿½ she sputtered, but the physician only gave her a stern look and raised an eyebrow.
ï¿½If you don't take off your dress now, I'll just have to assume that you didn't put on the bands and consider our agreement cancelled. It's your decision.ï¿½ The older woman began to turn towards the door.
ï¿½No, please Dr. Weaver, please, I'll do it, please,ï¿½ Jill blurted out, not believing that it was herself saying that. When the other woman didn't react, she pulled her dress off in desperation and cried ï¿½See, Dr. Weaver, I've taken it off! Please, just have a look, please!ï¿½
The doctor slowly turned back towards Jill, a sly smile appearing on her lips as she took in the state of her victim. Jill glanced down at her own breasts and nearly gasped. The rubber bands were being quite effective in shutting off the blood circulation, so both breasts had turned a reddish blue colour and appeared to have grown at least two inches. Her nipples stuck out obscenely, looking ready to burst.
ï¿½Now, now, Jill, you really shouldn't shout so loud, given your appearance. You wouldn't want the neighbours come out and see you, would you?ï¿½ The doctor teased her. Jill had another pang of embarrassment running through her and winced, but she was given no time to gather her senses. The woman reached out with to hands and started to rub Jill's nipples with her thumbs, sending tingling waves through her body. Jill wanted to sink into the ground, she couldn't bear the thought of being used like this in the public, and most of all, she felt utterly betrayed by her own body.
Doctor Weaver slipped her index finger under the rubber band on Jill's left tit and stretched it a bit, then let it snap back with an audible plop, making her wince. ï¿½Now come on, hurry inside. We've got a lot to do today.ï¿½
Jill followed the older woman inside, shivers of dark apprehension running down her spine.
