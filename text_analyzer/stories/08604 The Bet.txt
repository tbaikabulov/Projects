Synopsis:  When Kristen is accepted into an all-female college at a top English university, she is excited at the chance to explore a foreign country for the first time, and just a little disappointed that her college is only for girls.  She immediately becomes great friends with her three roommates, and when they introduce her to �the bet� that all new students are offered � to remain naked for an entire night, outside, without moving � she decides to accept with only a little reluctance. When she�s caught and brought in before daybreak, however, she loses the bet and must face the consequences of playing at all.






The Bet
Prologue
The envelope was unexciting. At first glance, the plain white exterior looked like it might be from the bank, or a sales company. Most likely it was just a bill, demanding money as such things do. On a closer inspection, however, the multitude of stamps on the front would reveal that this envelope had flown across the Atlantic from England. It definitely wasn&#8217;t a bill.
The young woman who picked it up from the mailbox casually flicked her hair out of her eyes as she glanced at her name on the front, before ripping it open. There was a second pause, then a scream of delight as she went tearing back into the house.
The letter read:
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dear Miss Kristen Lomatts,
I am delighted to be writing to you to inform you that we would like to offer you a place at our college for the coming school year, starting in October.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;University of Cambridge, England
 
Chapter 1 &#8211; The Arrival
Kristen gazed out of the car window at the English countryside that was rolling past her. Everything had a sharp, colourful clarity in her excitement; she could see individual branches on the trees, even though they were doing 40 on small, country roads.
The journey from her home had gone without a hitch. She had driven to the airport, and got there in plenty of time to catch her plane to London, Heathrow. When she arrived, the driver had been waiting for her, and had helped with the bags. And now, she was only 10 minutes from the university she had always been fascinated by.
She leant forward, and pulled down the mirror from the roof. She had been constantly checking her appearance ever since she had got into the car, until eventually the driver had commented that, in his opinion, she looked fine. They had both laughed at that, and made pleasant chit-chat the rest of the journey.
In fact, she looked quite a lot better than fine. Her blonde hair reached just below her shoulders, and was slightly wavy, complementing her deep, greenish eyes. She had quite high cheekbones that her makeup had been carefully chosen to enhance. She lowered her eyelids to apply a little more mascara to one side of her eye, adjusted the strap of her top, and sat back again, satisfied by her appearance.
�It&#8217;s coming up here on the left,� the driver said, tipping his head towards a sign as they drove past. And indeed, it said, �Lady Alleesha College, 3 miles� with an arrow pointing off to the left. As the driver took the turn, Kristen took several deep breaths, trying to calm the nerves that had suddenly filled her stomach. 
As the car pulled smoothly round another corner, she gasped, and the driver smiled. A short way along, there was a tall wall with a shiny, black metal gate opening onto the road. Above the gate, gleaming gold lettering announced �The Lady Alleesha College for Women�, with delicate carvings of flowers surrounding the words.
But that was not what had made Kristen gasp. As if pulled directly out of a Jane Austen story, the college sat behind the beautifully trimmed lawns, which the late afternoon sun was highlighting giving it a shimmering appearance. The college building itself had smooth white columns in front of it, holding up a magnificent porch. The building was truly exquisite.
The driver followed the road and stopped outside the main entrance, behind the two other cars that were already parked there. It was only then that Kristen noticed the people milling around the entrance. She knew the college didn&#8217;t have that many students &#8211; only a few hundred &#8211; and there were only a few people around. As she opened the door, a friendly looking middle-aged woman separated herself from the group and came over to the car.
�Hello, there,� the woman beamed. �My name is Samantha, and I&#8217;m the undergraduate admissions tutor for the college. You&#8217;ll have received your letters from me, so it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re already friends!� She winked. �And who are you?�
�I&#8217;m Kristen. Kristen Lomatts. It&#8217;s great to finally be here!�
�Oh yes, you&#8217;re one of our new international students!� Samantha smiled. �Where are you from, honey?�
�The States,� replied Kristen. �Near LA.�
�Excellent! Women from all over the world come to study at Lady Alleesha, so don&#8217;t worry about being the odd-one-out. Now, we offer 1, 2, 3 and 4 person rooms &#8211; I&#8217;ll just have a look� yes� mm� here you are. You are in one of the four rooms, room 165, so I&#8217;ll get one of our helpers to help you with your things. Classes don&#8217;t start for another week, as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll know, so you can use this time to get to know everyone and make some friends. There&#8217;s plenty of information in the main entrance hall, which will tell you about the town and so on, so I&#8217;ll leave you to get settled in. OK? Great!�
Kristen took a deep breath as the lady bustled off to deal with another car that had just pulled up &#8211; she didn&#8217;t know anyone could talk so fast, for so long! Her driver, honked, waved and pulled off as she waved back. Hefting one of her bags, she let the other woman who had just come over lift up the other, and they both went into the building.
The other woman, who had announced her name was Karen, was in her final year studying law. As they walked under the porch, and entered the cool, slightly musky entrance hall, Kristen looked about in wonder.
The hall was clearly extremely old. The floor was a dark oak, covered in the centre with a thick rug. On either side, dark staircases rose up over giant arches that led to either side. At the end of the room, another door was propped open, leading into a beautiful grass courtyard, with flowers set around all the edges.
Karen led her up one of the staircases, through a door and along a narrow corridor. Eventually, they turned a corner and arrived at a door marked &#8216;Room 165&#8217;. From behind, the sound of female voices came floating through, punctuated by the occasional laughter. Karen knocked on the door several times, and stepped back, dropping Kristen&#8217;s bag to the floor as she did so.
�Come in!� shouted a voice.
 Nervously, Kristen turned the handle and pushed open the door, hurried along by Karen&#8217;s hand gently pushing her forwards. Strangely, as the door opened and she looked in, her first impression was not of the magnificent view from the window. It was not of the suitcases littered about the floor, or the soft-looking beds spaced around the room.
No, her first impression was of the people sitting on the beds &#8211; and how good looking they were. At any other time, if she had been asked to guess what these girls did, she would have guessed &#8216;models&#8217; or &#8216;actresses&#8217;. Now, however, she felt immediately self-conscious.
What she didn&#8217;t know was that the occupants of the room were all thinking much the same thing about her. Kristen had never been the most extrovert of people, and although she was aware that she was pretty, she didn&#8217;t know just how good looking she was. 
At 5&#8217;6&#8217;&#8217;, she was of average height, but had a sort of aura about her that made her seem a little taller. She was naturally slender, and didn&#8217;t have to do much work at the gym to keep her perfect physique. The shape of her breasts, large but not overly big for her frame, was clearly visible through the thin, slightly clinging top she was wearing, and her arms and shoulders were bare, apart from the thin strap. She was wearing jeans, as the English weather was not known for its excessive heat, but they were low-cut and very tight to the knee, before flaring out around her feet. In all, it was not surprising that the room&#8217;s occupants thought that she could also be a model or actress.
There was an awkward silence while everyone stared at everyone else, before Karen broke it, saying, �Well, I have to get back to entrance. Everyone, this is Kristen. I&#8217;ll see you all later!�
�Hey, do you need help with that?� asked one of the girls, pulling herself off her bed. �I&#8217;m Amie,� she added, as she pulled the suitcase over to the empty bed. She spoke with a slight accent, explaining that she came from China when Kristen pointed it out.
�This is Jess,� she said, gesturing to the tall latin girl lying on the bed next to Kristen&#8217;s, her arms over her face, dark brown hair matching her olive skin. �And Lyddy,� this time pointing to the other blonde woman who raised an arm and said, �Howdy� in response.
�We&#8217;re all in different years,� explained Amie, as she padded back to her bed, her feet enclosed in small, white socks. �I&#8217;m in my third year here. Lyddy is in her fourth, and Jess has just started her second. It&#8217;s like that for all the four person rooms. Sucks I couldn&#8217;t afford a single though, as lovely as these girls are.� She smiled, then a calculating look appeared in her eyes as she suddenly looked Kristen up and down, as it only just noticing her appearance properly.
�In fact, speaking of money, how about The Bet?� She said this to Lyddy, who got a slight smirk before deciding, �Maybe later.� 
�What&#8217;s that?� asked Kristen.
Amie smiled. �Tell ya later &#8211; let&#8217;s go get dinner.�
Chapter 2 &#8211; The Bet
Outside, the sky was just darkening. In the entrance hall of the college, the old clock was striking eight o&#8217;clock in the evening, the dull sound thrumming out around the building. The four roommates were talking loudly as they made their way back up from the eating hall to their room.
Inside, Kristen set about unpacking her clothes from her suitcase. The other girls, having already finished their unpacking, set about doing their own thing. Amie settled down in the chair to one side of the room with a book. Jess and Lyddy both lay down on Amie&#8217;s bed, watching the TV.
Kristen was just sorting her underwear when a thought occurred to her. �So,� she announced casually, �what&#8217;s this &#8216;bet&#8217; then? Something I should know about?�
The sudden increase of excited tension in the room would not have been lost on a small animal, and Kristen definitely detected it. It was as if all three of the girls had been waiting for this since the moment she stepped into the room. Amie slowly put down her book, and Jess and Lyddy only kept up the pretence of watching the TV for a few seconds. Finally, Lyddy looked up at her.
�So you want to know about The Bet then. Are you sure?�
Kristen looked around at each of the eager faces of her new roommates, then laughed. �Sure.�
�Excellent!� She looked around the room, then adopted a slightly deeper voice. �If you&#8217;re all sitting comfortably, then I&#8217;ll begin.�
�Imagine the scene. It&#8217;s in this college, maybe even this room, almost 150 years ago. There, a young girl named Isabel has just joined the college. But she has a problem &#8211; she has very little money, and may not even be able to complete the first term.� Lyddy looked around, meeting the eyes of each person in the room. A slight breeze rustled the curtains, and everybody jumped.
�Desperate, she asks her roommates for help. They go away to think for several hours, and when they come back, they all have a sort of evil smile on their faces. They say that they have an idea that may be able to help her. But it won&#8217;t be easy; she&#8217;ll have to work for it. She says she&#8217;ll do anything.�
�The oldest girl explains that they suggest a bet, a wager of the strangest kind. If she chooses to accept it, together, they will pay for her fees for the whole year. If she doesn&#8217;t, things will go on as they have done. There is just one catch &#8211; if she should accept, and fail, she must be a slave to them, doing their every whim, for the entire year.�
�As you may expect, she is scared. Terrified, even. But what choice does she have? She asks to hear the bet.�
�It is explained that the bet is quite simple. She must strip off her clothes in her room. Then, at nine o&#8217;clock in the evening, she must make her way &#8211; naked &#8211; to the entrance hall, and out into the courtyard. She must go to the centre of the grassy area, and lie down on her back, with her arms and legs outstretched, like a cross.�
�She then must stay there until seven o&#8217;clock in the morning, before the groundsman comes around, without moving her arms or legs from their positions at all, for any reason. If she succeeds, she wins the bet, and does not need to pay for her position in the college. If she loses, she still does not have to pay, but she cannot leave and must act as a slave for the whole year. And for the whole night, someone will be watching her.�
�Now this girl had a will of iron, and accepted the bet, confident that she could succeed. And indeed, succeed she did. From that point forth, it has been tradition that if the three elder roommates agree, The Bet must be offered to the fourth and newest, under the same conditions as before, and with the same risks. Few have agreed, and fewer still have succeeded.�
�We have agreed to make the offer. So, you have to ask yourself, Kristen from the USA. Do you have what it takes?�
A deathly silence followed this speech, as Kristen looked around the room in disbelief. She could scarcely credit what Lyddy had just said, but it was quite obvious that the woman had meant every word she had said. 
�I didn&#8217;t take it,� said Amie suddenly. �And neither did Jess.� Jess shook her head. �So don&#8217;t feel bad if you don&#8217;t want to, the last time someone said yes was about 8 years ago, I think.�
�What does &#8216;slave&#8217; mean? If I did it, and lost, what would I have to do?� asked Kristen.
�Anything.� Lyddy was speaking again. �Anything at all, that we three want. It could be work, it could be chores, it could be sleeping out in the hallway. Whatever.�
�And what happens if I didn&#8217;t do what you wanted, after I was this &#8216;slave&#8217;?�
�That would be a mistake.� It was said in a friendly way, with no hint of malice. It was more a statement of fact than a threat. It was still obvious what was meant.
Kristen thought about her own bank account, dangerously empty. She thought about the beautiful building and grounds. She thought about the record of academic achievement of everyone who went here. She thought about her parents, delighted that she should go so far to succeed.
�I&#8217;ll do it.�
�OK then,� said Lyddy in a matter-of-fact voice. �It&#8217;s 15 minutes to nine now. Jess, go and tell everyone that we have a taker! Kristen &#8211; you&#8217;re a brave girl. It&#8217;ll be tough. Good luck.�
Chapter 3 &#8211; The Preparation
Thoughts were whirling around in Kristen&#8217;s head. Everything had happened so fast, that she wasn&#8217;t really sure she knew what was going on. She was pretty certain that she&#8217;d just agreed to stay outside for a whole night, totally naked, in front of everyone. That wasn&#8217;t like her at all!
Even as she thought of all the things that could possibly go wrong, however, she felt a faint tingling between her legs at the thought of so many people seeing her completely naked. The tingling grew stronger as she imagined them lining the windows around the courtyard she&#8217;d been standing in just an hour or so before, as she lay herself down and spread her legs�
At that moment, someone tapped her on the shoulder, and she jumped, turning away from the window she had been staring through. Jess, her eyes bright with a sort of exciting anticipation, whispered in Kristen&#8217;s ear, �It&#8217;s time. You&#8217;ll need to strip.� She giggled slightly, and gestured to the centre of the room.
The pit of Kristen&#8217;s stomach went cold, and she looked up at the other three girls, all on their beds again, just watching her. For a moment, she considered backing out, but the money would be so helpful &#8211; she had been wondering how she was going to get through the first year for months. Anyway, she was not one for backing down on a challenge.
Raising her chin, she took a few steps to the centre of the room, and said in a voice slightly too high, �Well, I&#8217;d better lose them then!� Amie gave her an encouraging smile, and she felt slightly reassured, and less self-conscious. 
Raising one foot, she balanced on a leg as she slipped off her shoe, and threw it onto her bed. She repeated this with the other foot, then took off her socks, and threw them over as well. Standing barefoot in the centre of the room, she could feel every fibre from the soft carpet. It felt like her every sense was fixed in this moment. 
Taking a deep breath, she took hold of the base of her top, and slowly lifted it up. As she pulled the top over her head, Lyddy and Jess shared a pointed glance. Her stomach was completely flat, toned by occasional visits to the gym and a fast metabolism. Her skin was flawless, slightly paler than her arms, and with no blemishes.
But most of all, her breasts, concealed only partly by the black, slightly lacy bra, were full and perfectly formed. The vague shapes of her nipples were just visible through the thin material. Kristen finished pulling the top off, and tossed it onto the bed. She glanced up at the other girls, and quickly glanced down again: their attention was completely fixed on her.
A cool breeze blew through the still-open window, and Kristen shivered as goose-bumps rose over her arms and stomach. Without looking up again, she turned slightly red as she struggled to undo the button on the front of her jeans. As it finally came undone, she shifted her hips from side to side as she pulled them over her panties and stepped out of them. 
If Kristen had looked up again, she would have seen that the attention of the other girls was going further beyond that of some friends watching someone do something embarrassing with every piece of clothing she removed. Her legs, too, were seemingly perfect. Slightly longer than the rest of her body, they were well proportioned, and a pale cream. The professional wax she had invested in before leaving had paid off &#8211; the red spots had faded completely, leaving her legs completely smooth.
Kristen did not look up. She tossed her jeans over to the bed as well, barely noticing as they hit one side and slid onto the floor. Here was the part she was least looking forward to. After all, most of her school friends had seen her in her underwear. None had seen her topless &#8211; she was more careful in the changing rooms than most.
�It&#8217;s five minutes to nine, honey,� said Lyddy, breaking her from her thoughts. �If you want to back out, you still can, until you take off the bra.�
Kristen thought for a long moment, and then reached up behind her back. Her fingers brushed the bra strap before settling on the clip. The room was totally silent, everyone engrossed in the spectacle as there was the tiny click of the clip coming free.
Pulling the side straps down over her shoulders, she took another calming breath, and shrugged the bra off. Her breasts bounced free, pert and full. The areolae were a pleasant pink, contrasting with the white skin of her breasts. Even as everyone stood, or sat, completely still, the cool air was making the nipples tighten as they slowly became hard and erect. 
Kristen blushed as the other three girls examined her, their eyes never leaving the smooth skin. The bra was left on the floor, discarded. Kristen desperately wanted to cross her arms and hide her nipples from the searching glanced of the girls, but she was held in place by a mixture of pride and horror that the others wouldn&#8217;t take their eyes off her.
At another word from Lyddy, she half groaned, and her slim fingers moved down to the band holding up her panties, almost of their own accord. Not quite a thong, the lacy underwear that had seemed so sexy when she had put it on, assuming that no one but her would ever know, suddenly seemed to shrink and provide virtually no cover at all.
Coming to a decision that she might as well get it over with, she reached through the band and quickly slipped the panties down her legs, stepping out of them with difficulty as she was trying desperately to keep her legs crossed to hide her mound and pussy, before tossing them to the bed. She shivered slightly, and held her arms awkwardly down by her sides.
Despite her efforts to conceal them, it was obvious that her sex and ass were completely free from hair &#8211; a painful but worthwhile result of the same waxing clinic that did her legs. The slow strip and undiminished attention of the observers had the result that Kristen was now feeling aroused: she fervently hoped that no one else had noticed that her pussy was already quite wet.
�Shit, girl. You are hot.� It was Jess who had made the comment, approval written all over her face, her almond eyes almost shining. Kristen blushed again, even more than before, and self-consciously crossed her arms over her breasts. She just managed to mutter a thanks, before trying again, saying in a voice much more confident than she felt, �Well, I&#8217;d better go have a lie down then!�
Chapter 4 &#8211; The Courtyard
The journey downstairs was quite unremarkable. Kristen had half been expecting that every single person in the college would be watching from their doors, but not a single one was open. She padded down the stairs, bare feet making virtually no sound, accompanied only by Jess.
They both looked around carefully before easing the door to the courtyard open. Darkness had fallen, but the courtyard was bathed in a gentle light from the lamps around the corners. The windows surrounding it were dark &#8211; with the light outside, it would be impossible to see who was watching her.
As she stepped out, she blushed again and tried to cover herself even more with her arms as a whistle came from one of the windows, followed by a female giggle. Kristen had to keep reminding herself that, at least, no men were here to see her plight.
Jess escorted her to the centre of the yard, then looked pointedly at Kristen&#8217;s attempts to cover herself. �There&#8217;s not much point doing that,� whispered Jess. �Everyone will see when you lie down. Remember, if you move your arms or legs at all, you lose.�
Kristen had a moment&#8217;s respite as she sat down on the grass, her crossed legs hiding her pussy and breasts. Then, she shut her eyes, and lay down, before very slowly spreading her legs and placing her arms above her head in the shape of a cross. 
She just heard Jess make a murmuring of approval, before the other girl went over to the courtyard door and went in, locking it behind her from the inside. Kristen just lay there for a few minutes, eyes still shut, wondering what she looked like.
The grass beneath her was soft but rough in a pleasant sort of way. It was cool outside, and the combination of the weather and the excitement at being naked with people watching had made her nipples completely erect; they were pointing upwards like small spikes.
Another cold breeze blew over the courtyard, and Kristen shivered. At the same time, a small itch began on the side of her stomach. She almost moved down to scratch it, before realising that in doing so, she would lose the bet after just a few minutes. The sudden realisation that she was as good as tied up made her pussy throb, and arousal flood through her body.
Kristen moaned as her pussy got wetter, and the gentle arousal increased. There were other itches over her now &#8211; on her feet, her thighs, one of her forearms, the bottom of one of her breasts. The more she tried to ignore them, the worse they got. And the pleasurable sensation of the cool breeze on her pussy &#8211; knowing that if she closed her legs to hide it, she would lose. It was maddening.
It was several hours later, in the middle of the night, when things began to go wrong. Despite everything, Kristen had managed to remain still, spread eagle on the ground, without moving her arms or legs. She hadn&#8217;t slept at all &#8211; the excitement, danger and wind had made her so horny that sleep was impossible, like having a vibrator only just touching her, with no relief.
It was then that a small, dry leaf, blown over the buildings into the courtyard from one of the trees in the ground, blew between her legs and got caught against her thigh. For a few minutes, she didn&#8217;t even notice it, concentrating entirely on the wetness of her pussy. Then, the wind blew again, and it moved against her thigh. It itched. It tickled.
It was like a cruel twist of fate &#8211; no matter how she wriggled her butt up and down, her whole stomach flexing with the effort, she couldn&#8217;t dislodge it. And caught where it was, just against her thigh, between her legs, it began to feel slightly different.
The tiny leaf had been stuck there for almost half an hour when she cracked. She didn&#8217;t scratch one of her itches, or move the leaf away. Forgetting the entire situation, and letting out a loud moan, she brought her arms down and began rubbing herself. In the back of her mind, she realised that she might be seen, but she didn&#8217;t really believe that anyone would still be watching. Besides, the demands of her body could not be ignored.
As she pumped her fingers in and out of her pussy, the other hand rubbing her breasts, she let her eyes shut. All the anticipation, pleasure and denial of the past six hours came out in a flood, and with a small scream, she came harder than she had ever done before.
Breathing heavily, she lay there for a while, then opened one eye a crack. To her horror, one of the lights in one of the rooms had come on. Her room. Inside, Jess and Amie were looking down at her, smiling smugly. She opened her eyes properly to see them, and Jess, with evident pleasure, called down softly. Two words floated over through the air, and Kristen shut her eyes again in despair. 
�You lost.�&nbsp; 
Chapter 5 &#8211; The Consequences
Despite the fact that she had lost, no one came down to open the door to the courtyard. Instead, the light in her room went out, and the faces disappeared. Kristen sat up, covering her breasts, unsure of what she should do. In the end, she walked over to try the door. It was still locked.
Eventually, figuring that she might as well see what happened, she went back to the centre of the yard and lay down again, spreading her legs and arms. Now that there were no consequences, it seemed even more exciting to be exposing herself fully, and she half hoped that lots of the girls were watching. Eventually, with the stress of the bet gone and exhaustion setting in, Kristen fell asleep, naked on the grass.
She woke up suddenly. Lyddy was standing over her, smiling broadly, and shaking her shoulder. Without thinking, Kristen raised her arm to protect her eyes from the light, before, with a jump, she realised she was still completely naked and Lyddy was smirking at her breasts.
She stumbled to her feet, crossing her legs tightly. In the early morning brightness, her nakedness again seemed terrifying. Covering her breasts with one arm, and her pussy with the other, she gloomily followed the still-smirking Lyddy back inside.
�Don&#8217;t worry, Hon,� commented Lyddy as they climbed the stairs. �We&#8217;ll still pay for you to stay here. After all, we definitely don&#8217;t want you to leave!�
Kristen was silent for several seconds, then asked, �About the whole slave thing. I was naked the whole night, in front of everyone. That&#8217;s the point of this thing. The &#8216;slave&#8217; doesn&#8217;t actually mean anything, right?�
Lyddy gave her a smile, and patted her arm. �Sure it does. There&#8217;d be no point in playing otherwise, mm?�
When they got back to the room, the other two girls were still in bed. Amie was lying under the covers, with only her arms out, reading. Jess was lying on top of the covers wearing only a skimpy bra and thong. 
As they came through the door, both looked up. �Hail, the brave Kristen!� shouted Jess, and Amie laughed. Kristen groaned and ran over to her bed, pulling the cover around her. The feeling of being enclosed, hidden, was wonderful. She sighed in bliss.
�Can I ask you a personal question, Kris?� asked Jess. She had the same look in her eyes that Kristen had come to recognise, and dislike.
�Um, sure.�
�Have you ever had sex with a woman?�
The question was so unexpected that Kristen sat there for several seconds before finally managing to stutter out, �No!�
�But you&#8217;ve thought about it.�
�Maybe once or twice� why?�
�While you were outside?�
Kristen turned and looked directly at Jess, who was smirking again. �How did you know?�
�Call it a hunch. And your pussy was wet yesterday. Liked all the attention did you?�
Kristen didn&#8217;t even try and answer this time &#8211; she just stared in disbelief.
�What Jess is trying to say,� ventured Amie, �is that we&#8217;re all lesbians. Most of the college is in fact. We sort of thought you knew that� and were probably one too.�
Lyddy continued, �Yeah. Anyway. You were wondering what the whole slave thing would involve. Have you ever heard of BDSM?�
Kristen stared at her some more.
�Guess not. It&#8217;s basically a sexual, master-slave relationship. You&#8217;re going to be our sex slave.�
Kristen fainted.
Chapter 6 &#8211; The Room
When Kristen came around, the first thing she noticed was that she was most definitely still naked. Completely. The second thing she noticed was that she was tied to her bed, spread eagle, without the covers over her &#8211; she could just see them on another bed. She pulled on the ropes a bit, but nothing gave. She felt the first tingle deep inside her pussy, and her nipples began to harden.
The only person in the room with her was Jess, who was just watching her intently. As they made eye contact, Jess smiled. �Hey there. You&#8217;re awake! We couldn&#8217;t believe it when you fainted.�
She came over to the bed. She was still wearing what she had been wearing before &#8211; a tiny red bra that was slightly sheer, through which her dark nipples were clearly visible and completely erect &#8211; and a matching red thong with lace decorations. 
She looked stunning, the colours perfectly complementing her dark, olive skin. Her eyes, almond coloured, were bright with excitement, and as she came over Kristen could see that her thong was sopping wet. Jess was tall &#8211; around 5&#8217;8� &#8211; and her legs were her best feature, long and sun-kissed. Her stomach was flat and well toned, and her breasts gently swayed up and down in the tiny bra as she walked. Her hair, long and straight, came down around her shoulders, accenting her long neck.
She sat down on the edge of the bed. Kristen pulled on the ropes and tried to shuffle away, but there was very little give, and she couldn&#8217;t move her arms at all to cover herself from Jess&#8217; searching eyes. Despite her predicament, and the fact that she didn&#8217;t consider herself a lesbian at all, she could feel herself becoming more and more aroused. 
Jess looked down at the girl bound to the bed next to her. She really was stunning! Her pale skin was slightly flushed from the exertion of wriggling against the ropes, and her tits were bouncing around as she struggled.
Eventually, Kristen gave up and slumped back on the bed. Jess had sat there watching her as she struggled, clearly enjoying herself, but also clearly confident that Kristen wouldn&#8217;t call out. And she had no intention of calling anyone &#8211; she didn&#8217;t want a teacher, or another student, walking in while she was naked and tied up with another girl sitting over her in virtually no underwear! The quickly growing wet patch on the sheet below her told another story as to why she was quite happy staying where she was.
�What are you doing?� Kristen eventually asked, after Jess had sat there staring at her breasts for several minutes. �Why have you tied me up?�
Jess smiled at her, and placed her hand on Kristen&#8217;s shoulder. Kristen shivered, and made a few jerking motions with her bound arm, which Jess completely ignored. 
�You&#8217;re going to spend most of this week tied up darling. To get you ready for the rest of the year. We&#8217;re going to have so much fun with you! I knew I had to see you properly &#8211; you know, naked &#8211; the moment you came through the door. I hoped to show you my body as well.�
�Untie me! I will call out, you know.�
�You made the bet, you agreed to be our slave, to do what we wanted if you lost. You lost. Besides, I don&#8217;t think you really want anyone coming in now, do you? And of course, we filmed everything last night &#8211; including that awesome masturbation. I cummed three times just thinking about it! If you call out, or don&#8217;t do what we say, that video goes to the school and all your friends and family back home. You&#8217;ll be kicked out.�
Jess suddenly reached out and traced her finger down the side of Kristen&#8217;s body. Kristen stared at the girl sitting next to her. She had almost forgotten that she was tied up naked, completely helpless. The video couldn&#8217;t get out! And she had made the bet�
�What are you going to do to me?� she asked. Even as she said it, she realised again just how horny she was. Jess really was extremely beautiful, and her nipples and pussy were aching to be touched. She knew she&#8217;d be masturbating furiously if she could, but the ropes wouldn&#8217;t let her move at all.
�Lyddy decided that we should ease you in,� she said, tracing her hand gently over Kristen&#8217;s stomach, and wriggling it in her belly button. Kristen giggled, then groaned as another wave of arousal hit her pussy.
�And as we&#8217;re all girls, and you&#8217;ve never had sex with a girl before, you can&#8217;t be a very good sex slave. So, I have the honour.� She smiled. Kristen looked up at her, her eyes wide. Suddenly, Jess leant down next to her and buried her face in Kristen&#8217;s neck. Kristen&#8217;s first reaction was to pull away, but when the tight ropes reminded her that this was going to happen whatever she did, she decided she might as well enjoy it. Kristen moaned.
Jess reached behind herself and unclipped the small bra. Her tits rolled out, full and perky, nipples standing out proudly. She leant back down and began kissing Kristen&#8217;s neck, licking it. Her hands began rubbing Kristen up and down, never quite touching her breasts or inner thighs, but gently stroking and massaging.
Jess moved her head, flicked her hair out of her face, and planted her mouth over one of Kristen&#8217;s nipples, who gasped and then moaned at the new sensation. The pleasure was unbelievable, the nipple stiffened even further, and became even more sensitive. Jess lifted her mouth off it, and kissed and licked the rest of the tit, then suddenly pinched the nipple, hard. Kristen let out a small squeak, but the arousal was so great that it didn&#8217;t really hurt.
Jess then moved herself fully on top of Kristen&#8217;s bound form. With her left hand, she reached down and began stroking Kristen&#8217;s thighs, slowly getting higher. She put her right hand behind Kristen&#8217;s head, and slowly leant down to kiss her. At first, Kristen lay there passively, but as the stimulation of her legs continued, she began to return the kiss with more passion, until she was eventually driving her tongue into Jess&#8217; mouth.
Suddenly, Jess pulled off her and turned round, and planted her face between Kristen&#8217;s legs. She reflexively tried to close them, but the tight ropes reminded her how helpless she was. The sudden sensation as Jess began to fuck her pussy with her tongue drove Kristen over the edge, and she threw herself against the ropes as the best orgasm of her life pulled her back into darkness.
It was going to be a long year.
